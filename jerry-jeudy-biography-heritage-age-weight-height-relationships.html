dollars.&nbsp;</span></strong><span>This tremendous salary is entirely due to his talent, commitment and hard work.&nbsp;He works hard in his games, which is why he is the best player on his team in the NFL.</span></p><h2><span>Jerry Jeudy: Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p><span>Jerry Jeudy was born on April 24, 1999 in Deerfield Beach, Florida, in the United States of America.&nbsp;He is the only son in his family after his sister died when he was six years old.&nbsp;He has always been a silent man when it comes to personal information and facts about his parents.&nbsp;Jerry finished high school at Deerfield Beach High School in his hometown.&nbsp;He was primarily employed in the sports industry.&nbsp;He continued his studies at the University of Alabama and looks forward to a great future.</span></p><h2><span>Jerry Jeudy- Relationship, married life</span></h2><p><span>Jerry is now engaged to Antoinette Tharp in a love affair.&nbsp;He has another son, Journe Aaliyah Jeudy, who is not related to the couple and is barely a month old.&nbsp;Journe was born in 2020, so we don’t know who he was in a relationship with.&nbsp;He dedicates all his time to polishing his talents and to improve himself from the person he was the day before.&nbsp;He spends his free time talking and traveling with his relatives.</span></p><h2><span>Jerry Jeudy- Professional Career</span></h2><p><span>In Alabama’s second game of the season, Jerry caught the first pass of his career against Fresno State.&nbsp;Jeudy has 14 receptions for 264 yards and two touchdowns like a true freshman.&nbsp;Jeudy had meniscus surgery in the spring before his sophomore season in 2018, forcing him to miss some spring practices.&nbsp;He claimed to have fully recovered in time for fall camp.&nbsp;“Actually, I’m in a really good mood.&nbsp;To be honest, I had forgotten how much it hurt.”&nbsp;Jeudy was named All-SEC Preseason Third Team during the SEC Media

touchdown against Duke in Game 1 and 103 yards and three touchdowns against New Mexico State.&nbsp;Only two more games of the regular season saw Jeudy eclipse the 100-yard rush, due in part to quarterback Tua Tagovailoa’s season-ending injury.&nbsp;On September 14, 2020, Jeudy made his NFL debut against the Tennessee Titans, recording four receptions for 56 yards in a 14–16 loss.</span></p><h2><span>Controversy</span></h2><p><span>Jerry was arrested Thursday, according to the Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Office.&nbsp;The night he was arrested, his girlfriend made a shocking
