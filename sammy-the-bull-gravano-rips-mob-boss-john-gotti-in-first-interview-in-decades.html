I hear more crying and complaints about John than you, the position he put you in. And he betrayed you. When he betrayed you like that, that was a rat move,’ ” said the ex-Mafioso, seemingly referring to former Boston mob capo Robert “Bobby” DeLuca, <a href=#>who was sentenced to 66 months behind bars in 2018</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/gotti_gravano2.jpg><p>Gravano added of his former Gambino boss, “Your job as John Gotti is not to put me away so you can get out and I can take the weight — that’s a rat move.”</p><p>Gravano, an admitted mass murderer, turned rat in exchange for a sweetheart prison deal and eventually a life in witness protection. Meanwhile, Gotti was convicted of murder, extortion, racketeering and tax evasion in 1992 and died of throat cancer in prison in 2002 while serving a life sentence. Before his conviction, he also was known as the “Teflon Don’’ — because criminal charges never stuck to him.</p><p>Gravano then famously left the federal protection program in the mid-1990s, claiming it was too restrictive.</p><p>He ended up getting nabbed for running a massive ecstasy ring in 2001 and was charged in both Arizona and New York over it, landing concurrent 19-year and 20-year prison sentences.</p><p>He was <a href=#>released early&nbsp;in 2017</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlfnp7kGlma2lfqK6uudhmq6GdXZfCrbiMoKmarpGjvG6%2ByKmqZqWfl3qju9KsZKOnmKN6qLvTraBmoZ5is6q%2B0q1koqakmr%2B3tcSwZKKmXZmypK3Dnqpo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-ac-green-should-be-in-the-nba-hall-of-fame.html><span>←</span><span>Why AC Green should be in the NBA Hall of Fame?</span></a>
