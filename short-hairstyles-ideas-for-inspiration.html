Fashion</a><strong>&nbsp;shares the hottest short hairstyles to consider in 2023:</strong></p><h2><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Stacked bob</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/54a5ccec3835-beyonce-stacked-bob.jpg><p id=ed5yqE8LuCo data-wc=80>&nbsp;The stacked bob features graduated layers, cut shorter at the nape of the neck and longer around the face. "This style is a triangular silhouette that works best on textured or curly hair," hairstylist and trend forecaster<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;Tom Smith</a> tells<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Hello! Fashion</a>. "Cutting a blunt horizontal line that allows the curls to stack up creating a triangular silhouette really shows off the beauty of natural curls as they are shown in contrast with a strong silhouette and a structured shape."</p><p id=ekgTNxG1rDc- data-wc=13><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Hairstyle ideas: 9 looks to beg your hairdresser to recreate in 2023</a></strong></p><p id=eC_FBu60cGNZ data-wc=16><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>This is going to be the biggest SS23 hair trend according to Princess Diana's hairdresser</a></strong></p><h2><strong>2.</strong> <strong>French bob</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/fb2788a9d751-french-bob.jpg><p id=erHoVX0mKiLd data-wc=78>Embrace your bubbling Francophile tendencies with a jaw-length bob featuring a short fringe. "The French bob is great on textured or wavy hair, it's a precision cut that gets its personality from being worn with your natural messy texture," Tom explains. "Very wash-and-wear, it's a super low-maintenance style, but does need to be trimmed every six weeks." The upkeep means that you will save time on the day-to-day styling, because the strong shape should just fall into place.</p><h2><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Banged bob</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/378a46c6804d-kerry-washington-banged-bob.jpg><p id=eB_jutm3JCs1 data-wc=87>This textured, longer style represents the progression of the French bob with a greater focus on the bangs. "Layers are kept to a minimum and a sharp right angle connects the fringe and bob length. The shorter the fringe, the bolder the result," Tom says. "The beauty of such a strong haircut is that it works equally as well blow-dried and straightened as it does left to dry naturally. A leave-in texture cream such as Evo's Liquid Rollers will encourage natural texture and eliminate fluff or frizz."</p><p id=e_3J0Vf3ZySO data-wc=10><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>3 retro-inspired hairstyles that are majorly trending right now</a></strong></p><p id=eaqYHLrdVo2E data-wc=12><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>5 quick hairstyles for an instant-glam effect according to an expert</a></strong></p><h2><strong>4. Polished lob</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/bd1b67663655-lea-michele-polished-lob.jpg><p id=ecTIcl7IJRSf data-wc=49>This precision cut is great for medium to thick hair and has a certain ultra-luxe appeal. The best way of styling the polished lob? "Give yourself a smooth blow dry using Evo's Lockdown Leave-in Treatment and use a round brush to style the ends slightly inwards," according to Tom.</p><h2><strong>5. Sharp bob</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/513c605d62b7-lucy-hale-blunt-bob.jpg><p id=e5ytYT7Q-qY9 data-wc=103>A chin-length sharp bob works well on straighter or medium-fine hair types as it encourages thickness and looks well high impact. It works well with a middle or side parting and Tom recommends that it should be styled straight or with a minimal kink. "Ask your stylist for a precision haircut that sits around your chin length," he says. "Style this by using your straightening irons just on the last couple of inches of the length to give the sharpness to the edge while retaining volume and movement overall. You can also tuck one side behind your ear for a more styled look."</p><h2><strong>6. Midi-flick bob</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/d1d8e1133fc3-jenna-ortega-midi-flick-bob.jpg><p id=eIVxOQq3nU5K data-wc=94>Reluctant to commit to a classic bob? Bend the rules with the midi-flick style, featuring sweepy bottleneck bangs and textured layers to provide a sense of movement. "Ask your stylist for your length to be cut above your collarbone and kept blunt, adding a soft bottleneck bang and face framing 'shag'-style layers without losing the solidity of the bob line," Tom says. "This length will naturally flick out on the neckline - this is very cool at the moment and ties into the ‘cosy girl’ aesthetic, so embrace the 'flickyness' and style with texture."</p><h2><strong>7. Botticelli bob &nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/9fe468ce2d41-laura-harrier-botticelli-bob.jpg><p id=ezj_j_b1e_ data-wc=69>The trend for ruffled, Renaissance-inspired waves has now evolved into a shorter, sharper winter version. "The slightly triangular silhouette is fantastic for rounder and more square face shapes, and can be adjusted with a middle or side parting depending on preference and suitability," Tom says. "The key here is no layers. Keep the length blunt and straight and allow your natural waves or curls to be free and fluffy."</p><h2><strong>8. Bullet bob</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/db88b5636d01-florence-pugh-bullet-bob.jpg><p id=eqzBDfeY4odG data-wc=94>"We’ve seen the mullet, wolf, shag cut, so what’s next? I predict the 'Bullet' Bob will be 2023’s biggest focus for shorter hair," Tom says. "This haircut is an evolution of the wolf cut/mullet/shag styles that have been building over the last 18 months and rather than returning to a classic bob shape, this mid-length haircut has had a 'mullet' inspired makeover incorporating outgrown curtain bangs with a layered bob shape. The 'two-layer' cut has the balance of a mullet (longer and heavier toward the back) but retains texture and detail around the face."</p><h2><strong>9. Hollywood bob</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/d7a415cfdcf7-lily-james-hollywood-bob.jpg><p id=e7D9JKrWUgKn data-wc=101>Defined by a deep side parting, flipped fringe and smooth edges, this style has "all the romance and elegance of classic Hollywood glamour but with an edge, provided by the sharp shoulder skimming shorter length," according to Tom. "Ask your stylist for a long bob cut on a side parting with no layers. A long sweeping fringe, cut to be flipped over will help get that elegant volume at the front. This<strong>&nbsp;</strong>style works fantastically with some of the latest blow-drying tools – check out Dyson's Airwrap, Shark's FlexStyle and other hot brushes to help you achieve this bouncy, blown-out finish."</p><h2><strong>10. Curtain cut</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/593a169771ee-kim-kardashian-curtain-cut.jpg><p id=eaDakvlj-fQr data-wc=106>The curtain cut is extremely flattering in the way it frames the face, "particularly for those with a longer or leaner neck due to the crisp contrast between the horizontal line of the haircut and the long vertical necklines," according to Tom. "To keep the edges of this cut crisp and sharp use a straightening iron (my go-to is by Cloud Nine which has an easy-to-use temperature control to adjust to your needs) and slightly turn the ends under and toward the face. The trick here is smooth slow movements – if you don’t get it perfect straight away, let the section cool before trying again."</p><h2><strong>11. Classic pixie</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/54c2e7026b48-emma-watson-pixie.jpg><p id=e6MAG3e7lq data-wc=81>Subversive and androgynous or soft and ethereal, the pixie can be adapted to suit your individual aesthetic. "This cult classic rightfully finds itself among the current hottest short hairstyles," says celebrity session stylist <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Alice Theobald</a> "For styling, I recommend you use a heat protection product such as Sam McKnight's Save The Do Blow Dry Style Starter and an extra small brush like Denman's Head Hugger. To enhance the movement, finish with Morgan's Pomade Texture Balm for a soft natural separated finish."</p><h2><strong>12. Short wolf&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/4c7ae7d9385a-short-wolf-haircut.jpg><p id=eDPvxmIiZlBd data-wc=78>The canine-inspired layered chop is still set to be big for 2023. "Spritz a root booster throughout your locks like Sam McKnight's Cool Girl Superlift Volumising Spray and blow dry using a diffuser attachment and small circular movements on a medium setting," Alice advises. "Go in with a curling tong, flipping out irregular sections if you desire extra movement, and finally enhance the texture with a couple of pumps of Morgan’s Pomade Volume Powder directed into the roots."</p><h2><strong>13. Rounded bob</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/9795da4eb6d4-michelle-williams-short-bob.jpg><p id=eOLKhAuDFCkn data-wc=85>A glossy bob with a round silhouette works really well when your hair is a nourished and healthy. "Before styling, applying a hair mask such as Wella’s Professional Nioxin Deep Repair version is always a good idea," Alice advises. "Protect your mane with heat protection spray and blow dry your locks, directing the nozzle down the hair shaft to smooth and seal the natural shine. Using Matador’s pintail comb, find the middle parting and tuck the sides behind your ears, leaving face framing side slices."</p><h2><strong>14. The bixie</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/47aaf85314e0-bixie-haircut.jpg><p id=eWrBtbKoCQ43 data-wc=59>This style blends the classic pixie with a slightly longer length – guaranteed to "seriously raise your cheekbone game", according to Alice. "Blast your hair until it is around 50% dry, add the nozzle to your hair dryer then flick the hair up at the back and first side section, continue rolling the brush under for the inner sections."</p><h2><strong>15. Short shag</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/853e14546883-short-shag-haircut.jpg><p id=eXtIx2z8QM2T data-wc=83>A cool cut packed with textured shaggy layers, the short shag works best with some movement. "Comb through L’ANZA’s Design Foam, and using the nozzle on your hairdryer, direct the hair onto the face for the fringe section and ruffle using fingers," Alice says. "Swap the nozzle for a diffuser and create some movement using Drybar’s The 3-Day Bender Curling Iron on random sections. Finish with Morgan’s Pomade Volume Powder and piece it out with your fingers for a matte, voluminous textured result."</p><h2><strong>16. Shaggy pixie</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/b205c10ef454-shaggy-pixie.jpg><p id=etTBqrSiztxo data-wc=86>With choppy layers at its core, the shaggy pixie is great if you’re all about the low-maintenance vibe. After applying a strong-hold mousse, blast the hair until it’s half dry and separate out some inch-sized sections. "Using a small round ceramic brush, blow dry the hair and direct it forward to frame the face," Alice advises. "When it is completely dry, apply a heat protection spray, and go in hot brush to softly piece out flick the face framing, finishing with a mist of strong hairspray."</p><h2><strong>17. Pixie mullet</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/abb30122ea54-pixie-mullet.jpg><p id=eFKgdA5dwZo5 data-wc=70>Razored within an inch, this super short mullet is all about the texture. "Apply a voluminous mousse to freshly washed hair and blow dry using a hairdryer with a diffuser attachment. Add texture using a small round brush – I like to tweak the look by going in with an iron to boost the dishevelled, undone look by taking random sections and piecing them out with a flick," Alice says.</p><h2>18. Box bob</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/7961d8db420f-hailey-bieber-box-bob.jpg><p id=eo0myk5l3A data-wc=50>Hailey Bieber's box bob inspired a wave of chops earlier this year, and for excellent reason. The clue's in the name, the boxy shape features a high impact, blunt finish and absolutely no graduation. The style is great for finer hair as it can add the illusion of increased thickness.</p><h2>19. Slick pixie</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/37e72fd77d1f-bella-hadid-slick-pixie.jpg><p id=eu8blllcj4 data-wc=45>The slick pixie is great if you're wanting to exude a touch of vintage glam. <a class=hm-link href=#>Bella Hadid</a> rocked the style a few years ago, harking back to the subversive La Garçonne look of the <span><strong>1920s</strong></span>. Style yours swept over to one side, with angular sideburns.</p><h2>20. Curved bob</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/29f2c8f2b7b1-jourdan-dunn-curved-bob.jpg><p id=e2WsOfsuUH data-wc=34>The curved bob is super similar to the round bob, only this style has a subtler difference in length between the outer and face-framing lengths for a more oval rather than circular overall effect.</p><h2>21. Micro fringe moment &nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/2f43274874c3-emma-roberts-with-a-mini-fringe.jpg><p id=eDuWHG0OT905 data-wc=39>Not for the fainthearted, the micro fringe can be pretty arresting. Finishing anywhere from halfway down the forehead and above, these bold bangs are guaranteed to make an impact and, on dark, glossy locks, have a slightly retro air.</p><h2>22. Hepburn homage&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/70192f602d37-zoe-kravitz-audrey-hepburn-bangs.jpg><p id=eAh01BlFc2 data-wc=37>Audrey Hepburn's side-swept micro bangs proved that a shorter fringe didn't have to mean super edgy, and modern day screen star <a class=hm-link href=#>Zoë Kravitz</a> followed suit this side of the century with a look that focused on separation.</p><h2>23. Boyband bleach</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/ce188b73e4da-iris-law.jpg><p id=e0dtvPl6vw data-wc=37>This one might not have caught on just yet, but there's no denying that It-girl <a class=hm-link href=#>Iris Law</a>'s platinum, undone crop feels categorically cool. The middle parting feels super 90s and it works harmoniously alongside her slitted brows.&nbsp;</p><h2>24. Choppy cub</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/bdced02149b7-mia-regan-hair.jpg><p id=e9pyIT5L7i data-wc=38>Uncomplicated and free-spirited, the suitably named 'cub' is a shorter, edgier version of the wolf cut. It has a sharper feel, plus a slight air of grunge when paired with dark smudgy liner à la model <a class=hm-link href=#>Mia Regan</a>.</p><p id=eDZDClM2L5ji data-wc=21><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our Hello!
