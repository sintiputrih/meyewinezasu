Cole is the current “it” guy of the Hip Hop sphere who manages to keep family affairs private. A recent&nbsp;<a href=#>iTunes</a> review revealed that the recording artist and his wife, Melissa Heholt, welcomed their daughter on Wednesday.</p><p>According to the review, “the two-part suite ‘She’s Mine’ may be the most important songs he’s written, as Cole hovers over his daughter and finds himself overcome by a strange feeling: hope.”</p><p>Needless to say that both media and fans were shocked to hear the news. “J. Cole married his gf, made a whole baby & album without the media knowing .. Dude is the true definition of ‘lowkey,'” noted one fan. R.J. Glosson of Houston, Texas tweeted, “J. Cole had a surprise album, a surprise marriage and now a surprise child. He’s going to go down as GOAT.”</p><p>J. Cole has been making waves in the music industry. His latest album, 4 Your Eyez Only, is highly anticipated by many and criticized by some. A few have accused J. Cole of using his lyrics to take shots at veteran rappers. J. Cole, however, remains focused on other things in life such as happiness and self-fulfillment.</p><p>“You’ll never have enough,” J. Cole said during an interview with <a href=#>NPR</a> in 2014. “You’ll never have enough success if success is what you seek,” he explained. “You’ll always be reaching. And I realize that if you’re trying to attain something that’s unattainable, you will never be happy. You will always be in a pattern of temporary happiness and satisfaction.”</p><p>4 Your Eyez Only makes its public debut on Friday. Check out the album’s trailer below!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kG9mampfZYVwtdJmoWabn6Gybq2Mp5ywZZSWsXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dolly-parton-house-height-measurements-bra-size-married-divorce.html><span>←</span><span>Dolly Parton House, Height, Net Worth, Bra Size, Married, Divorce</span></a>
