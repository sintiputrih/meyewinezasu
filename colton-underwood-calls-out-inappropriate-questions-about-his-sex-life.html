<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Colton Underwood Calls Out Inappropriate Questions About His Sex Life</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Drawing the line. <a href=#><strong>Colton Underwood</strong></a> was open <a href=#>about his dating life</a> during his time on Bachelor Nation, but this time, he’s keeping things closer to the chest.</p><p>On Sunday, May 16, the former NFL player, 29, answered fan questions via Instagram. When he received a question about how many men he had hooked up with, he decided to share the question — and his lengthy answer — to his Story.</p><p>“Let me vent for a second. Questions like this are inappropriate. I understand you might know me from <a href=#>The Bachelor</a> where I shared a lot about my personal life,” Underwood wrote. “I have set boundaries and I’m respecting myself in a way that will lead me to a healthier life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Colton-Underwood-Calls-Out-Inappropriate-Fan-Questions-About-His-Sex-Life-002.jpg><p>He then reflected on his time on Bachelor Nation. The First Time author first appeared on <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a> in 2018 before briefly appearing on <a href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a>. He then became the lead of season 23.</p><p>“I never asked to be <a href=#>labeled as the virgin bachelor</a> and have people feel the security to ask me questions about my sex life,” he shared on Sunday. “It just happened and during that time I thought I had no other choice but to just go with it the network would be mad. I know differently now. I’ll share what I want and this won’t be one of those things.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the Q&A, he teased that <a href=#>his upcoming Netflix series</a> — which will feature his coming out to his parents and his <a href=#>journey of living life as a gay man</a> — is set to come out in the fall.</p><p>Underwood came out as gay during an April interview on Good Morning America. Earlier this month, he detailed his choice to <a href=#>live as his true self in an interview with Variety</a>, revealing that he was previously blackmailed, receiving an anonymous email threatening to release photos of him at a spa known for its gay clientele.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He also shared that at one point in his life, he was on a gay dating app under an alias and had some interactions with men over the years.</p><p>“I’ll say this. I was ‘the Virgin Bachelor,’ but I <a href=#>did experiment with men prior to being on The Bachelorette</a>,” the Indiana native shared. “When I say ‘hookups,’ not sex. I want to make that very clear that I did not have sex with a man, prior to that.”</p><p>After becoming famous, Underwood was worried one of the men would out him. “I remember feeling so guilty, like ‘What the hell am I doing?’” Underwood said of his encounters. “It was my <a href=#>first time letting myself</a> even go there, so much so that I was like, ‘I need The Bachelorette in my life, so I could be straight.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacp5ypvK951KebnqqnpLylecKao6WrXaTCtXnIp5ipqKKkvbO1wK2cZqmlmsC1tc6nqmaZkqTCtXnHoqpmq5Wteq21xZ5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./barbara-hershey-htm.html><span>←</span><span>Barbara Hershey - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</span></a>
