Not one to be messed with, Mirman decided to take justice into his own hands with a full-page local newspaper ad (and then also paid the ticket). “What kind of a hose$&it charge is that?” he wrote. “It’s illegal to back into a spot?

I bought two puppets, who turned out to be gay. Just kidding, they’re puppets. We stopped in cute shops, ate a popover and saw Black David Cross. It was nice.</p><p>Then — when we returned to our car on my windshield was a ticket. “What could this possible be for? I thought. I paid for three hours of parking (but only used two — you’re welcome, Portsmouth). Is it a crime in Portsmouth to not use all the parking you bought? How’d you know I’d be back early? Do you have a PreCrime division? Why are your PreCogs working on traffic tickets? Shouldn’t they be out preventing Street Performers before they happen? But, no. I read the violation — we backed into a spot and were fined $15 for being “parked in wrong direction.”</p><p>What kind of a hose$&it charge is that? It’s illegal to back into a spot? Before I embarrass myself, I want to make sure that Portsmouth is still inside the United States and not considered a part of Iran?</p><p>You’re probably thinking, “Well, if before visiting Portsmouth, like everyone else — you’d simply first gone to the City Clerk’s Office website, clicked on City of Portsmouth Ordinances and looked in Chapter Seven — Vehicles, Traffic and Parking. Right there in section 7.316: BACK TO CURB it says, ‘No vehicle shall remain backed up to the curb.’” similarly, if you had gone to my website before I came to your city and clicked on Eugene’s Ordinances, you’d know that in Chapter One under “F%#k You Don’t Steal My Money” in section 8.215 it says, “F%#k you don’t steal my money.”</p><p>But even if I had gone to your website — it states that the online ordinances are not an official copy — that for the official ordinances, I have to call 610-7245. Why no area code? Am I calling from a local payphone in 1986? But instead, I foolishly looked around for signs, both real and from God. I saw nothing, but I heard God’s voice, and he said, “This is f%#king bull$&it. You need to write them a letter.”</p><p>Lastly, as you know, New Hampshire’s state motto is General John Stark’s celebrated quote, “Live Free or Die,” which he famously said before attempting the first recorded self-BJ. If John Stark was alive today, he would be 287 years old — also, right after learning about cars, General Stark would then be disgusted to discover that Portsmouth doesn’t even give people the freedom to back into a spot — which by your own state’s twisted logic, turns my $15 ticket — into a fight to the death.</p><p>With Great Disappointment In You,<br>Eugene Mirman</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-068c73f492d775b75e9d97ac4705bf05-7-0-0@published data-word-count=5>And the infamous park job:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>For those wondering, here's a photo of the car backed into the garage in Portsmouth, NH. <a href=#>http://t.co/uTA0FljvFD</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/gzAVwgANAx</a></p>— Eugene Mirman (@EugeneMirman) <a href=#>July 14, 2015</a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-068c73f492d775b75e9d97ac4705bf05-9-0-0@published data-word-count=11>Bless you, Eugene. <a href=#>We can’t wait to hear more about it</a>.</p><h2 class=sources>Sources</h2><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>H/T Mashable</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Eugene Mirman Deals With Parking Tickets Best</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlobmdgbHymwcaepZ5lnZ6%2Frq3NZqeaqpueu6h506KapJ2kYrumw9KpmKmdomKupXrHraSl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lyrics-zach-bryan-november-air.html><span>←</span><span>Zach bryan november air lyrics</span></a>
