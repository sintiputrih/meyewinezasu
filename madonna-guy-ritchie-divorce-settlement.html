The British film director tied the knot with the Queen of Pop back in 2000, and share their two&nbsp;sons together.</p><p>Despite the duo appearing to be a match made in heaven, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Madonna and Guy Ritchie officially split up</a> in 2008. Although the news of their divorce was a major surprise, the divorce settlement was an even bigger shock! Considering the 'Vogue' singer is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">worth $850 million</a>, you know the amount owed to Ritchie was big, and we mean big!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Madonna Speaks Out For Britney ‘Give This Woman Her Life Back’</a></span></p><h2 id=madonna-paid-guy-ritchie-how-much>Madonna Paid Guy Ritchie How Much?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Madonna and Guy Ritchie found love in one another back in the late 90s! The duo officially tied the knot in 2000, thus commencing Madonna's official "British era", in which she adopted an English accent and moved on over to London.</p><p>While the '4 Minutes' singer still has a slight accent, there is definitely one less British thing about her, and that's no longer being married to film director, Guy Ritchie. Although their divorce was somewhat amicable, considering Madonna and Guy share their two sons, Rocco, and David.</p><p>Despite their efforts at keeping things civil, the duo was in a custody battle regarding Rocco up until 2018, so when we say "amicable", take that with a grain of salt! One thing that may have altered their relationship for good was their divorce settlement, and with Madonna being the money maker between the two, it was clear she'd have to give up a lot.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Fans Have Mixed Reactions To Madonna's Surprise Performance At Boom Boom Room</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Guy and Rocco have maintained a close and loving connection, Madonna and Guy remain on the outs, or so fans think so! This all stems from Madge having to dish out quite the hefty settlement to Guy at the time of their split.</p><p>When the figure was released, it became evident that it was one of the largest payouts ever in a divorce settlement, said Madonna's rep, Lis Rosenberg. So, how much did the Queen of Pop have to pay out? <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How does $92 million sound?</a></p><p>Yes, you read that right! Madonna was ordered to give Guy Ritchie a staggering $92 million, which included the value of the couple's former Ashcombe home in England. While Guy himself was worth a nice $45 million before the deal, he made it clear that he didn't want a sliver of Madonna's then $500 million net worth, but that was a lie!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Madonna took a major hit to the bank when she dished over nearly $100 million to ex-hubby, Guy, the singer is doing just fine today as she is now worth nearly double. Madonna stands as one of the richest entertainers, ever, with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $850 million.</a></p><h2 id=who-is-guy-ritchie-married-to-now>Who Is Guy Ritchie Married To Now?</h2><p>Guy Ritchie, who now has $150 million to his name, is certainly rolling in dough following Madge's major contribution to his worth.</p><p>In 2015, Guy Ritchie found love yet again in model and actress, Jacqui Ainsley. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">duo have been happily married since</a>, and have welcomed three children together, all while co-parenting Ritchie's two kids from his time married to the 'Hung Up' singer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Guy Ritchie continues his work within the film industry, working on recent projects such as The Gentlemen, Wrath Of Man, and Aladdin, to name a few.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Fans Mistake Madonna's Boyfriend For Jaden Smith</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmpyfo7uiecausGaqmamwqbXEZpuirp%2BnsKZ50p6rraSVorKvwI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kp-black-ink-compton-wife.html><span>←</span><span>Here Are All the Details About 'Black Ink Crew: Compton' Star KP's Main Squeeze</span></a>
