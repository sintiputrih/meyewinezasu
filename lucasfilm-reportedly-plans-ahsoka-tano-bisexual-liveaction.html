According to sources close to WGTC – the same ones who previously told us that the Togruta former Jedi will <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">show up in The Mandalorian&nbsp;season 2</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rey is Palpatine’s [SPOILERS]</a>, both of which are now confirmed – <strong>Ahsoka Tano</strong> will be revealed as bisexual in future appearances. This side of her won’t depicted in the aforementioned D+ show, but it will feature into their additional plans for the character, we’re told.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/C4YiuZhVYAAUkEJ.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ET41YdDUwAAJTT3.jpeg><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true>We’re also hearing that Ahsoka’s bisexuality might be hinted at at some point in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Clone Wars</a>&nbsp;season 7. After all, an Ahsoka-focused arc is currently unfolding on the final run of the animated series, with the heroine befriending two sisters, Trace and Rafa Martez, in the Coruscant underworld. So, it’s feasible that there could be a suggestion of a romantic chemistry between Ahsoka and one of them in the coming episodes.</p><p data-characters=591 data-current-count=591 data-injectable=false>But even if not, it’s important to remember that Lucasfilm has big plans for the character in live-action, as we’ve heard that a solo series for <strong>Ahsoka Tano</strong>, probably with Dawson still attached, could be in the works for the streaming service. If this is the case, then that would be the perfect place to dip into her personality a little deeper in this way. Regardless of where it happens, though, we’re told that the plan is indeed to portray her as bisexual and as soon as we learn where they’ll start showing that side of her, we’ll be sure to let you know.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ytwcKaqp%2BhnKJ6s7HPqKmtnZShxm68y5qlrGWRncCwt8Bmq5qmn2Kvqr%2FEsayapF2htrexwJyroqeeZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wendy-zuckerman.html><span>←</span><span>Hire Wendy Zuckerman to Speak at Events</span></a>
