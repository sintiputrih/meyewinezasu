Unfortunately, though, it’s also been filled with a handful of stinkers like The Astronaut’s Wife, The Ninth Gate&nbsp;and <i>Mortdecai</i>. Yet, it’s somewhere in between these two vastly different levels of quality where you can find some of Depp’s most interesting work, even if the material itself doesn’t make for the best of his films.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=670 data-current-count=670 data-injectable=true>One of the famous actor’s appearances that hovers in the realm of underrated movies is 2009’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Enemies</a><strong>, </strong>which was directed by Michael Mann and stars other great actors like Christian Bale, Marion Cotillard and Jason Clarke. For those unfamiliar with the pic, it’s&nbsp;an American biographical crime drama that adapts the story of Bryan Burrough’s non-fiction novel, <i>Public Enemies: America’s Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI</i>. Set during the oppressively bleak era of the Great Depression, the story follows the notorious bank robber known as John Dillinger (Depp) as he’s tracked down by FBI agent Melvin Purvis (Bale).</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/158515416174369896-48.jpg alt="Public Enemies" width=1121 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1121px) 100vw, 1121px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=552 data-current-count=552 data-injectable=true>While Public Enemies sits at a mediocre 68% on Rotten Tomatoes, that hasn’t stopped the film from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">occupying a spot on Netflix’s Top 10 movies list</a> for over a week now. It isn’t the best drama to have graced the screen in the past few decades, but <strong>Johnny Depp</strong> and the supporting cast have all been widely praised for their charismatic and believable performances. And given that it’s still sitting at #5 on the aforementioned Top 10 list, it’s clear that it’s finding a bit of a second life on the streaming platform.</p><p data-characters=163 data-current-count=163 data-injectable=false>Tell us, though, have you checked out&nbsp;Public Enemies&nbsp;since it’s been on Netflix?
