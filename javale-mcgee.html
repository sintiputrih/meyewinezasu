Although her date of birth is not clear, it is assumed that she was born between 1988-1992.</p><p>This beautiful Latin American girl lives in the USA now. She is believed to be in a romantic relationship with Javale. However, not much information is available about this beautiful girl. It is unclear about her family background and early life.</p><p>She has graduated from the University of California with two degrees. We have no clear idea of what this girlfriend of the star athlete does. But following her on social media, we have found out that she loves to work out to keep her fit.</p><p>Many sources tell us that she is into the real estate business now and used to be a fitness model previously.</p><p>Giselle Ramirez Wikipedia page is not yet available.</p><h2><strong>Height, Weight, and Measurements.</strong></h2><p>Ramirez is about 5’ 8” tall with an attractive body stature. As she is a fitness freak, she has an incredibly athletic look.
