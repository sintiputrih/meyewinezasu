When the siblings got into spats as kids, the actress’ parents told them to hug it out for hours on the front lawn in front of the neighbors.</p><p>“The whole time you’re just seething, you’re disliking this person with so much energy, but if you let go you have to stay there for an extra hour,” the <i>Divergent</i> star said. “That was the kind of reverse, manipulative psychology my parents were into!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>At school too, Woodley said her parents’ message was clear: Learn to deal with the negativity by trying to understand the other person’s perspective.</p><p></p><p><span>“And there were times in school, when someone said something really mean. It would hurt my feelings, and my parents weren’t on my side. They would be like, ‘I’m so sorry you’re feeling this way, but what do you think that person was feeling?’” she said. “Oh, I hated it. Now, of course, I understand; it enabled me to recognize that no one’s evil, they’re probably hurting and can’t express themselves, get no love at home, so it’s repeated.”</span></p><p><span>“It gave me a broader outlook: just put yourself in another person’s shoes,” Woodley said.</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The actress will next star as Lindsay Mills, the girlfriend of NSA whistle-blower&nbsp;<b>Edward Snowden</b>, who is played by <b><a href=#>Joseph Gordon-Levitt</a></b>, in the Oliver Stone–helmed biopic <i>Snowden</i>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasoJGeuaa6xGauqKeUobK6ecyyZJ%2BZnZ65unnIrGSsraCav26yjKScnWWlpXq4gJNpZ21wXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./elon-musk-women-he-has-had-12-children-with.html><span>←</span><span>Meet all the women Elon Musk has had his 12 children with: from first wife to a Tesla employee</span></a>
