The discussion also involves a very heartbroken <a href=#>Robyn Brown</a>, who is the last wife left standing at that point.</p><p>Other than wanting to go to Utah, Meri says that the split is "all coupled with everything else that's been going on and the statements Kody's made" about her.</p><p>"I'm not going to apologize for what I know in my heart is what I need to do," says Meri. "If it's going to hurt Robyn's feelings, if Kody's going to be jumping for joy, whatever the emotion that somebody else has about it is irrelevant."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How did Robyn and Kody react to Meri's decision to leave?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube/Entertainment Tonight (video stills)</a><p>Robyn and Kody Brown from 'Sister Wives'</p></figure><p>Robyn, who first asks Meri if her moving to Utah is temporary, begins to cry at the picnic table before the conversation ends.</p><p>"Despite the fact that I just feel like my world is crumbling down, I can't fight it because it's not fair to Meri," Robyn admits.</p><p>"What I really want to do is yell, what I really want to do is scream, what I really want to do is just say, 'No! Please, don't do this!'" she adds.</p><p>Kody, although he's not crying, is seemingly upset at Meri's decision, and not happy that she decides to go public about their split.
