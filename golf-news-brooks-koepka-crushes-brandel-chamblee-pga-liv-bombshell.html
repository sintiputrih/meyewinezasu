Since the Saudi-backed tour’s inception, Chamblee has not held back from bashing the PGA defectors for taking Saudi money. Among his victims of criticism are names of Dustin Johnson, Phil Mickelson, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brooks Koepka</a>, Patrick Reed, and Bryson DeChambeau.</p><p>Just recently, Mickelson and Chamblee have been going on a Twitter war amid the PGA-LIV controversy. Last year, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reed</a> filed a $750 million lawsuit against the TV analyst stating that his criticisms have been affecting his daily livelihood. Chamblee even stated that the Saudi-funded tour is “sportswashing” their image.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Welfare Check on Chamblee</p>— Brooks Koepka (@BKoepka) <a href=#>June 6, 2023</a></figure><p>Since Chamblee has always doubled down on LIV Golfers, the players took it as a chance to take an ultimate swipe at the broadcaster. Even Koepka’s coach <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Claude Harmon III </a>recently blasted Chamblee stating he’s just a “paid actor by NBC and Golf Channel”.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jay Monahan, Commissioner of the PGA TOUR, using 9/11 to shame players last year for taking life changing money from LIV…</p><p>Now, he has no problem with the money and merges LIV Golf with the PGA. Disgusting.<a href=#>pic.twitter.com/CUhIodZIpi</a></p>— Stephen Geiger (@Stephen_Geiger) <a href=#>June 6, 2023</a></figure><p>Amidst all the merger controversies, it was reported by the Saudi PIF Governor that LIV Golf CEO Greg Norman was kept out of the loop. Jay Monahan proved to be an active participant in the deal, while Norman was informed of the signing just moments before the merger revelation.&nbsp;</p><p>Norman has been trying to work together with PGA since 2022 but in vain. Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods clearly stated that as long as Norman remains the CEO there can never be a deal with the LIV regime. Even though McIlroy has admitted to LIV being a good competitor for PGA, this deal threw the players and fans off to great heights.</p><p><strong>In case you missed:</strong></p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brandel Chamblee drops “murderous dictator” take on LIV Golf’s partnership with Saudi Arabia</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57xqijn2WemsS0ecGrpqijo2K4sLHPpJhmm6KqwKmx0maZq5membKtecKhmKaanJqybrzGmmSloaZir7C5wayfnqScZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bachelor-nation-alums-share-their-lgbtq-coming-out-stories.html><span>←</span><span>Bachelor Nation Alums Share Their LGBTQ+ Coming Out Stories</span></a>
