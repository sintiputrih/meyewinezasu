However, the 26-year-old hasn't yet revealed her secrets. Meanwhile, reports suggest that the fiance of </strong><strong>Chase Chrisley</strong> <strong>might have followed a street-balanced diet and practiced a regularly exercised routine to lose weight and maintain her physique in proper shape and size.</strong></p><p><strong>Emmy Medders</strong> works for a corporation and is best known as the girlfriend of American television personality <strong>Chase Chrisley</strong>. She was born on November 1, 1995, to her parents <strong>Micheal</strong> and <strong>Leigh Medders</strong>. The reality star was raised in a Christian home and has a close relationship with her parents.</p><p>According to her LinkedIn profile, Emmy Medders worked for Jensen Strategic Partners, LLC. She was employed full-time in the company as a Personal Assistant. She previously worked as a verifications professional for Insight Global before joining Jenson Strategic Partners and held that position for around six months in late 2018 and early 2019.</p><p>Recently, Emmy Medders' longtime boyfriend <strong>Chase Chrisley</strong> proposed to her at Tennessee's First Horizon Baseball Stadium on October 5, 2022. Chrisley proposed to Medders in a 12,000-seat stadium with 175,000 rose petals arranged in the shape of a heart.</p><p>Later, Chrisley told People that it was the perfect night and that he wants to spend the rest of his life with Medders and that they can't wait to start a family together. As the news spread, many people were excited about it. Meanwhile, many people were also shocked due to her current weight loss appearance. They believe she has lost a significant amount of weight. So, many people have been curious to know more about her transformation.</p><p>Previously, we touched on the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>weight loss</a></strong> efforts of <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Gabriel Iglesias</a></strong> and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>PartyNextDoor</a></strong>.</p><h2>Emmy Medders’ Weight Loss: The 26-Year-Old Fiance of Chase Chrisley Has Reportedly Undergone a Significant Transformation; However, She Has Yet to Speak on How She Was Able to Lose Weight!</h2><p><strong>Emmy Medders&nbsp;</strong>(<a href=# rel=noopener>@emmymedders</a>) is a corporate employee who is best known as the girlfriend of American television star <strong>Chase Chrisley</strong>. Meanwhile, she is recently in the spotlight due to her weight loss appearance, when her long-term boyfriend Chrisley <a href=# rel=noopener>proposed</a> to her in a 12,000-seat stadium with 175,000 rose petals arranged in the shape of a heart at Tennessee's First Horizon Baseball Stadium.</p><p>Similarly, viewers were shocked by her current body transformation. Many people have appreciated her new look and have also praised her for her current weight loss journey. However, she has not been completely open about her journey on any social media.</p><p>Similarly, Emmy Medders, 26, understands how to care for her body and preserve her fitness and health because she exercises frequently. As a result, she is now in great health. Hence, it doesn't seem like her professional life will be affected by her intention to lose weight. Her lovely physique is enough to entice any male she desires. However, she has not revealed her diet and lifestyle.</p><p>According to reports, the American reality TV star follows an extremely strict diet. She works hard to maintain her beautiful shape and eats a healthy diet. Likewise, she might primarily consume healthy fruits and vegetables. Salad is one of the things she must include in her diet. Each of her lunch and dinner dishes includes a serving of rice. In addition, she no longer drinks coffee in the morning. Emmy Medders reportedly substitutes a glass of spinach juice, or perhaps fresh fruit juice, and some oatmeal with a handful of almonds for breakfast to get the day started.</p><p>Similarly, she also follows a rather rigid fitness regimen. Without a doubt, the TV star must keep her figure within control. Her diet and fitness routine, however, have yet to be confirmed. All of the above information is based on unverified sources.</p><p>Therefore, Emmy Medders has never talked openly about her weight loss secrets, so we can only speculate on how she did it. To begin, we can presume she underwent surgery to dramatically remodel her body, which is an instant answer to changing a person's body. Second, we might imagine she followed a strict diet and fitness plan to naturally change her figure. However, we must wait for her formal declarations to learn how she modified her figure.</p><h2>Know about Emmy Medders and Chase Chrisley's Relationship!</h2><p><strong>Chase Chrisley</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@chasechrisley</a>) recently proposed to <strong>Emmy Medders</strong>, his longtime girlfriend.
