On Friday at approximately 5:30 a.m., paramedic Steven finished his shift and reclined in the rear of his ambulance parked in front of a Campbelltown McDonald’s on Queen Street.</p><p>Authorities claim that during Tougher’s meal break, Jordan forcibly opened the ambulance’s rear doors and repeatedly stabbed Tougher in the stomach.</p><p>In addition, the accused did not appear at the Parramatta Bail Court on Saturday morning because he was undergoing a psychiatric evaluation in relation to his murder charges.</p><p>During the brief court hearing, neither Fineanganofo nor his family were present. And his attorney, Javid Faiz, chose not to request bail, resulting in the formal denial of bail.</p><p>After the court proceedings, the attorney for the defendant, Faiz, who represented Sydney Criminal Law Specialists, stated that his client had experienced psychosis.</p><p>In addition, the accused murderer of the paramedic had previously received treatment at a mental health facility.</p><p class=toc_title>Page Contents</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> Where is Jordan Fineanganofo?

Nationality</span></h2><p>The available information does not provide specific details regarding the nationality of Jordan Fineanganofo.</p><p>While it is comprehensible that people are inquisitive about the origin of the perpetrator, it is difficult to determine his nationality with precision in the absence of specific information about Fineanganofo’s background.</p><p>In addition, if we continue to investigate the assassination of the paramedic, the details regarding the suspect, including his nationality, will emerge.</p><p>Although the exact origin of the accused paramedic murderer is unknown, the public is aware that he was admitted to the Macarthur Youth Community Mental Health Facility in Campbelltown in 2021.</p><p>Therefore, we can infer that the criminal also resided in Sydney. In addition, we should contemplate the gravity of the crime committed by the 21-year-old and convey our condolences to the bereaved family, rather than searching for his nationality.</p><h2><span id=Jordan_Fineanganofo_Origin_And_Family>Jordan Fineanganofo Origin And Family</span></h2><p>There is little information available about the accused, Jordan’s parents. However, they are profoundly saddened and devastated by the fact that their son took the life of another person.</p><p>Toketa Fineanganofo, the father of Jordan, is devastated by the news and has conveyed his sorrow to the ailing family.</p><p>Toketa told the Sunday Telegraph, “We wish to express our deepest condolences to the family and for what has transpired.” We are out of words.”</p><p>All of his family members are in utter disbelief over what their son has done, and they have nothing to say other than their sorrow for the victim’s family.</p><p>Additionally, the perpetrator’s attorney, Faiz, stated that the accused is aware of his actions and their consequences and does not want parole.</p><p>Mr. Faiz stated, “I believe he had stopped treatment and medication at that time. He has psychosis-related concerns. Last night he was completely befuddled, but he is doing better today.”</p><p>In contrast, the paramedic family is utterly devastated, and Tougher’s newlywed wife and family have released a heartfelt statement.</p><p><strong>“Steven’s commitment to helping others shone brightest during his time as a NSW Ambulance paramedic and previously as a nurse,” they said.</strong></p><p><strong>“He was always ready with a smile, a kind word, or a helping hand, and he brought joy to those around him,” said his family.</strong></p><p>The Tougher family stated, “As we are still coming to terms with our loss, we request privacy at this time.”</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Personal Details, Career, And Wealth Of Gil Birmingham"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":37248,"10":2,"11":0,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://superstarsculture.com/personal-details-career-and-wealth-of-gil-birmingham/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/personal-details-career-and-wealth-of-gil-birmingham/"}{"1":65}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Personal Details, Career, And Wealth Of Gil Birmingham</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>murderer</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Meet Amari Avery Parents Andre And Maria Avery: Family And Ethnicity</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Rina Sawayama | Racist Comments | Controversy</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rm6CoZpOkunDDx56pnmWZqHqru9GdmKdllp67pq3NoJinp5akeqe%2BzqZkn5mdnrm6ec2aq6Knnpa5qsDYaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./molly-hopkins-new-boyfriend-90-day-fiance.html><span>←</span><span>Molly Hopkins Is Ready for Love Again on '90 Day Fianc: The Single Life'</span></a>
