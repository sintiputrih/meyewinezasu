<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Camila Cabello Stars in L'Oreal Paris Elvive Hair Comeback Campaign</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>We’re all about the comeback! In the second phase of its <a href=# rel=noopener>much talked about “Comeback” campaign</a>, L’Oréal Paris is teaming up with spokeswoman <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Camila Cabello</strong></a> to talk about how she has overcome obstacles in her career — and in dealing with her over-styled hair. A 60-second spot featuring Cabello and the Elvive Extraordinary Oil line is set to debut during the Grammys on Sunday, January 28, and it sounds like it will have a lot of people talking come Monday morning.</p><p>L’Oréal Paris kicked off its “Comeback” campaign during the 2018 Golden Globe awards, when it aired a commercial with <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Winona Ryder</strong></a>. In the spot, the Stranger Things actress anonymously appeared in slinky black dress complete with luscious locks, before her identity was finally revealed at the end of the ad.</p><p>“Everyone loves a comeback,” read a line on the screen. “Damaged hair deserves one too.”</p><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener>internet went wild in response to the clip</a>, and Cabello’s spot is likely to be just as buzz-worthy, considering she will seemingly be addressing her highly publicized exit from girl group Fifth Harmony in 2017.</p><p>“I think a comeback is defined as struggling through something and having the strength and resolution to push past it,” Cabello said in a statement. “For me, it was about taking chances, aiming high and believing that I was worth it. I can now finally hear everything my heart was telling me.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/evive.jpg><p>As for the “Havana” singer-songwriter’s long brown hair, over-styling and daily wear-and-tear have taken a toll on her tresses. The <a href=# rel=noopener>Elvive Extraordinary Oil collection</a> is specifically formulated for dry, undernourished hair like hers, and the Extraordinary Oil Treatment product is infused with camellia and golden sunflower oils to keep dull, damaged hair silky and luminous.</p><p>“We are very proud to partner with Camila for the launch of Elvive,” L’Oréal Paris USA president Tim Coolican said in a statement. “Elvive was designed to address the 80% of women in the U.S. who experience some form of hair damage daily. The line builds on L’Oréal Paris’ commitment to creating innovative products, services and experiences that help people look and feel their best every day.”</p><p>As though we needed another incentive to watch the Grammys, we’re interested to see what Cabello’s “comeback” entails!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5iurrXLmmScmZKaua27jKyrmqqjYravecuoqZ6ZnGK9or7IrGSepKaew6Z5x5qgq2WTpLqmrsCcomabkaK9orXGp2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bridgerton-season-2-episode-5-recap-an-unthinkable-fate-html.html><span>←</span><span>Bridgerton Recap: Mr. Duplicity</span></a>
