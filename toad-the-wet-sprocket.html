 Nov 8th 2018 !⃝ This song has stuck with me for a long time. It's written from the perspective of Jesus' younger brother, James. James was also one of the original 12 disciples. Imagine growing up in the shadow of an older brother you could never hope to better. This song is about the history of the early Christian church in the period immediately following Jesus' Resurrection (Book of Acts if you are a bible sort)."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

It's written from the perspective of Jesus' younger brother, James. James was also one of the original 12 disciples. Imagine growing up in the shadow of an older brother you could never hope to better.</p><p>This song is about the history of the early Christian church in the period immediately following Jesus' Resurrection (Book of Acts if you are a bible sort). This song occurred within the lifetime of people personally met Jesus. A fellowship of people who used to follow Jewish traditions is now adopting Christian beliefs and rituals, leading to the outgrowth of the Catholic church(es).</p><p>>>Changed the name of my brother<br>>Changed the things that he said</p><p>This refers to the fundamental changes in the early church which became increasingly based on Paul's teachings as he began to build churches. Paul was not one of the original 12 disciples; he was formerly known as Saul, and used to persecute Christians until he converted. He 'took' Judas' 'place' as a disciple of Jesus, but as James points out</p><p>>Says that he speaks to him<br>>But he never even knew the man</p><p>Paul/Saul never even met Jesus - he used to persecute Christians, and how he basically speaks for Jesus "Like he's God's own messenger".</p><p>This song expresses anxiety and doubt, but turns on the line</p><p>>But i'd give my life for him</p><p>This is James reassuring that despite his doubts and anxiety with how the church is changing, and in some ways, being distorted, it is serving a greater good, and James will stand with Paul.</p><p>It's held up well in 2018; imo it portrays biblical figures as real people, and is a treat for someone who looks at Christian beliefs criticially.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rcXRopqipqSav7G%2BxK2YraGfo8Bvr86mZq2nkZl6tbTEZq6erF2ovbO7wqScrWeWocZustGopGaglZbDpro%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./south-fl-billionaire-pledges-no-donations-politicians-dont-support-gun-control.html><span>←</span><span>South FL Billionaire Pledges No Donations To Politicians Who Don't Support Gun Control</span></a>
