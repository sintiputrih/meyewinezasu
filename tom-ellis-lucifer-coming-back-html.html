The show wrapped after 93 episodes and two platforms a year ago, but its fanbase seems to always want more from their favorite bad boy. Produced by <a href=#>Jerry Bruckheimer</a>, the series initially started on Fox, was canceled after three seasons, and revived by <a href=#>Netflix</a> after the streaming platform picked up the series, but now it seems that Tom Ellis and Lucifer might have more stories to tell.</p><p>According to a report by <a href=#>Screen Rant</a>, Tom Ellis may be back to star in Lucifer after the series’ showrunners confirmed that they are hopeful for a revival in the not-so-distant future. Joe Henderson and Ildy Modrovich have discussed a revival of the popular DC Comics character and series, joking that an iteration of the character starring Ellis could show up sometime on the Broadway stage or even in an animated series. There has not been confirmation that projects are in place to star Ellis as the devilish character again, but it appears that Henderson and Modrovich would be on board.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lucifer-tom-ellis-1280x720-1-900x506.jpg><p>As for Tom Ellis starring in Lucifer again, that’s another animal entirely. The actor portrayed a character that was made popular by DC Comics, The Sandman, which has its own adaptation that debuted on Netflix this year starring Tom Sturridge, <a href=#>Boyd Holbrook</a>, and Patton Oswalt. In <a href=#>The Sandman</a>, English actor Gwendoline Christie plays Lucifer Morningstar in a role that is closer to the character’s depiction in the original DC comics than Ellis’ version. Ellis was considered to reprise his part as Lucifer in The Sandman, but the series and comic book co-creator <a href=#>Neil Gaiman</a> felt that it might be too much to try to retool Ellis’ version to fit within The Sandman adaptation, so they recast the role instead.</p><p>However, fans of Tom Ellis have pointed to the fact that the television adaptation of Lucifer has had many lives since it first debuted on Fox in 2016. After quickly becoming a cult classic for the network, the show was canceled after three seasons but found new life when audiences found those seasons streaming on Netflix. Like some other failed series that came before it, Netflix jumped at the chance to pick up Lucifer, then upped its production costs, rehired many of the same actors, and continued the series for another three seasons on the subscription streaming platform.</p><p>Tom Ellis portrayed Lucifer Morningstar in Lucifer, the Lord of Hell who consults with the Los Angeles Police Department to solve crimes and run his ultra-high-end nightclub called Lux. The series also starred Lauren German, Kevin Alejandro, D. B. Woodside, Lesley-Ann Brandt, and Rachael Harris in supporting roles that gave each actor more screen time as the series progressed. The show saw many familiar faces in cameo roles and often hefty supporting parts that helped to drive the stories forward, including Smallville’s <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title="Tom Welling" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Tom Welling</a>, Battlestar Galactica star Tricia Helfer, Israeli actor Inbar Lavi, and Deadpool actor Brianna Hildebrand.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2isn6J6prjLoqpmpKWYtqex0WaaqKWZo7RursCcomegpKK5</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-owens-obituary-in-memoriam-of-john-owens.html><span>←</span><span>John Owens Obituary, In Memoriam Of John Owens</span></a>
