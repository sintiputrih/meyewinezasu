BaIn 2005, during her now infamous divorce from her first husband Brad Pitt, many pieces of the media spun a narrative that the cause of the divorce was that she was too career-driven and refused to have kids.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true><a title=@__jennaniston__ href=#>@__jennaniston__</a><p>❤️<a title=jenniferaniston href=#>#jenniferaniston</a> <a title=bradpitt href=#>#bradpitt</a> <a title=brennifer href=#>#brennifer</a><a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=viralvideo href=#>#viralvideo</a> <a title=usa href=#>#usa</a> <a title=xyzbca href=#>#xyzbca</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Faniston❤️" href=#>♬ original sound – Faniston❤️</a></figure><p data-characters=204 data-current-count=204 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">In an interview by Vanity Fair</a> following the divorce, Aniston criticized this narrative and pointed out that a man would never be accused of refusing to have children and causing a marriage to fall apart.</p><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true>After their divorce, Pitt quickly moved on to Angelina Jolie and established himself as the doting father to four children.
