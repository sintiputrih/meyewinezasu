Smialek announced that per the Boston Celtics draftee's autopsy, he died of cocaine intoxication,&nbsp;"which interrupted the normal electrical control of his heartbeat, resulting in the sudden onset of seizures and cardiac arrest,"&nbsp;as quoted by the <a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a>. Speaking at a news conference, Smialek noted that Bias' heart stopped just minutes after he ingested what might have been his first-ever dose of cocaine; there were no signs that he drank alcohol or consumed other drugs on the night of his death. The autopsy also indicated that Bias was in otherwise good health and was not suffering from any heart condition that might have contributed to his passing.</p><p>Talking about the cocaine Bias ingested, Maryland Drug Abuse Administration acting head Howard Silverman said that the star forward consumed an extremely pure form of the drug — "dealer-level quality,"&nbsp;as he described it.&nbsp;"You're not going to stop on the street corner and get that quality," he continued. "You'd have to be pretty well connected."</p><p>While Bias' autopsy revealed several details about how he died, there were some questions left unanswered — mainly, it didn't mention whether he swallowed, sniffed, or smoked the lethal dose of cocaine.</p><p>If you or anyone you know is struggling with addiction issues, help is available. Visit the <a href=#>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration website</a> or contact SAMHSA's National Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCEk2lubnFfmba0wNSrm6ilkZ67oIOMnZytmZmhwG6yzq6lnWWZo3qtsc1mmaKZo2KutsDOqaqyZaKavbC%2B02g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./barefoot-moscato-nutrition-facts.html><span>←</span><span>10 Barefoot Moscato Nutrition Facts</span></a>
