Maxx's Secret Runway Stores Sell Designer Items for 60% Off</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The product recommendations in this post are recommendations by the writer and/or expert(s) interviewed and do not contain affiliate links. <strong>Meaning: If you use these links to buy something, we will not earn a commission.</strong></p><p>If you crave designer fashion and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>can't resist a bargain</a>, you may want to know that select T.J. Maxx stores feature a section called the Runway. These store-within-a-store locations have designer apparel, accessories, and beauty products at seriously discounted prices—up to 60 percent off. As <a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#>smart shopping expert</a>&nbsp;<strong>Trae Bodge</strong> tells Best Life, the stores stock a bonanza of items by designer brands from Rag & Bone to Gucci to La Prairie. Curious to know more? Keep reading for the inside scoop on shopping at the Runway.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>7 Secrets Kohl's Doesn't Want You to Know</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/shutterstock_1888802773.jpg><p>T.J. Maxx uses the Runway to flag the designer goods in all of their stores (look for the purple tags), but Runway stores are specifically devoted to selling items that you'd find in this section.</p><p>If you're hoping to hit a Runway store, "the biggest issue is going to be location as they can be pretty limited," according to <strong>Julie</strong> <strong>Ramhold</strong>,&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>consumer analyst</a> with DealNews.com. "For example, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>some states</a> only have a single Runway store."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/tj-maxx-shopping.jpg><p>Though Runway items are significantly discounted from retail, expect prices to be higher than the usual T.J. Maxx finds and for the styles to be from previous seasons.</p><p>"I've seen reports that these stores can offer up to 60 percent off, but prices are still expensive," explains Ramhold. "These are still designer goods, so you aren't going to be able to get them for super cheap—but that doesn't mean they aren't good deals."</p><p>For example, Ramhold spotted a one-ounce vial of La Prairie's white caviar illuminating pearl infusion serum for $399.99, while the same bottle retails for $660 at Bloomingdales. "There are plenty of items that are under $100–but don't expect to pay $10 for a designer shirt that normally goes for $300," she adds.</p><p>In addition to the usual designer labels (think YSL and Elie Tahari), you'll also find styles from popular Danish brand Ganni, plenty of high-end denim brands such as RE/DONE, and cult skincare brands like COSRX, as Tik Toker <strong>Sierra Goodhue</strong> shared on a <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>recent shopping adventure</a>.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Nordstrom Has a Secret Clearance Store Where You Can Save Up to 95 Percent</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/04/tj-maxx-website.jpg><p>Don't live near a Runway store? T.J. Maxx has a Runway section online.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>TikTok money maven @millenialwealthsarah <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>revealed a few</a> of the designer finds that she found on the site, including Kevyn Aucoin makeup, Stella McCartney jackets, and both Cartier fragrances and diamond earrings.</p><p>But sizes and selection may be limited. There's generally more in the store, says Ramhold. "If you're close enough to visit a physical Runway store, you may have better luck."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/tj-maxx-best-time-shopping-news.jpg><p>Just like regular items at T.J. Maxx, pieces from The Runway also go on sale, as Goodhue pointed out when perusing the clearance rack.</p><p>Ramhold recently found a trove of temptations on sale, from glitzy dresses and tops to skincare products to necklaces and sunglasses, "even items like silk scarves, which may be out of season to some degree now, but could still be a great deal."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmraJdoq65xIyrrKevka56tMDOq5ysZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./raysowavyy-2.html><span>←</span><span>Raysowavyy Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</span></a>
