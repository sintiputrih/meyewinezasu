<a href=../../../../what-marvel-can-learn-from-wandavisions-mistakes.html></a>
To be frank, the WandaVision Series Finale left a lot to be desired. It sufficed in bringing Wanda's time in Westview to an end, but it disappointed audiences when none of the most plausible fan theories panned out. And on top of some obvious ones, like the MCU's Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) dropping in to speak with Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) not happening, several other subplots went unresolved. While the Disney+ series deserves credit for delivering some excellent storytelling over the nine-episode season, there's something to be learned from its lackluster finale.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Cynthia Scurtis - Bio, Net Worth, Height, Nationality, Married, Facts</h2><time>Feb 8, 2024</time>

When it comes to mascara, I have a very simple test: Will one coat make my lashes hit my glasses? I have to admit I was blessed with pretty good lashes. If I’m being honest, I don’t feel like I necessarily need mascara — my lashes are full, thick, and curled without it. Regardless, I’m obsessed with mascara anyway, especially because I want my lashes to pop behind said glasses. It’s been that way since my early teens, when tubes of CoverGirl and Maybelline littered my bathroom vanity.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Phony Pho Chicken Broth Bowls Modern Honey</h2><time>Feb 8, 2024</time>

Despite its name, Chinese water deer are found across Europe and possess remarkable survival tactics that allow them to thrive in varied climates.Wikimedia CommonsChinese water deer have unique tusks instead of antlers.
When you look closely at the Chinese water or “vampire” deer, it is obvious that they are different from any other type of deer you’ve seen. The most noticeable aspect of its appearance is the two robust tusks that protrude from the edges of the Chinese water deer’s mouth followed by a relatively adorable set of teddy bear-like ears.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Tina Turner Shared Health Issues Before Her Death at 83</h2><time>Feb 8, 2024</time>
