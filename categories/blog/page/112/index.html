Once the fire is extinguished, they continue to radiate heat for an extended period of time. Despite widespread belief that acorns’ acidity is detrimental to grasses, it appears that this is not the case with “ash” made from acorns.
Are conkers suitable for use in a fire?</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Cate Windelborn Obituary, A Precious Soul Gone Too Soon</h2><time>Apr 17, 2024</time>
