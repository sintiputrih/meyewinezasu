Long before Tokyo 2020 was saddled with cost overruns, scandals over sexism and fears it would turn into a COVID-19 super-spreader event, anti-Olympics activists were already calling the whole thing a disaster.
That was why one year before the pandemic-hit Games were originally slated to open in late July 2020, anti-Olympic activists convened in Japan for the first ever global summit of ‚ÄúNOlympians‚Äù, as those opposed to the Games are known.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Trey Santiago-Hudson Wiki, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Net Worth</h2><time>Jun 4, 2024</time>

Tyra Banks says Vogue‚Äòs new ban on underage and too-thin models is something worth ‚Äúsmizing‚Äù about.
