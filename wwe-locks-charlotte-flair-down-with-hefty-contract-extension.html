WWE wanted to lock The Queen down, and that is exactly what happened.</p><p>Sean Sapp noted behind Fightful’s paywall that Charlotte Flair recently committed to a contract extension with WWE, securing her presence within the company for an extended period.</p><p>This news surfaced after Madusa mentioned it on her podcast, and there was a delay in disseminating this information within the company.</p><p>Fightful has learned that Charlotte Flair agreed to a contract extension with WWE recently that will keep her with WWE for several more years. Madusa had said on her podcast recently that she’d heard this as well, and it took quite a while for people within the company to hear the same.&nbsp;</p><p>This contract extension marks the first post-TKO merger deal and predates the reported extensions for Dominik and Rey Mysterio. Notably, it includes a substantial increase in compensation compared to her previous contract, standing as one of the most lucrative deals offered to a woman in WWE’s history. The inclusion of a travel bus in the agreement aligns with the growing trend among professional wrestlers.</p><p>Despite the renewed contract, <a href=#>Charlotte Flair is set to be absent</a> from the wrestling circuit for an extended period due to impending surgery. <a href=#>The surgery aims to address issues with her ACL, MCL, and meniscus</a>. The wrestling community extends its best wishes to her during this recovery period.</p><p>Efforts are underway to uncover additional details surrounding the specifics of Charlotte Flair’s new contract. It appears that WWE may freeze her new deal due to this injury, because that is their historical course of action.</p><p>What’s your take on WWE re-signing Charlotte Flair to a longer deal?
