You can find skin-care routines, interesting new tidbits about little-known superfoods, think pieces on re-entering society after quarantine, and recipes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, what is Kourtney's recipe for her go-to avocado smoothie?</h2><p>Poosh prefaces the recipe for the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> avocado smoothie</a> by stating: "The fat-filled ingredient offers nearly 20 vitamins and minerals. Since avocados are high in fat, it’s best to eat the fruit in the morning so your body can burn the calories throughout the day. Kourt recently updated her recipe by swapping honey for dates. This tweak still adds a bit of sweetness and provides an additional source of fiber."</p><p>So there you go! If you were craving something sweet, then this avocado smoothie has got you covered. Here's how you make it:</p><p>Get a blender and toss in:</p><ul><li>1 organic avocado, pitted and peeled</li><li>1 cup organic plant-based milk</li><li>1 scoop of plant-based protein powder</li><li>1/4 teaspoon of MCT oil</li><li>2 dates (or 2 tsp Manuka honey)</li><li>1 teaspoon maca powder</li><li>1 scoop of Wild Greens Supreme</li></ul><p>Blend till liquid-ey and drink the heck out of it. However, beware, it's not everyone's favorite breakfast option.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>i just tried kourtney kardashians avocado smoothie bc i had the time today</p><p>i love cados and i love my aries sister kourtney k so i figured itd be a good idea</p><p>false.</p>— Your Local Black Socialist (@bbyreyn) <a href=#>October 11, 2019</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I tried making Kourtney Kardashian’s avocado smoothie this morning.</p><p>It’s not good.

After working out with her friends <a href=#>Addison Rae</a> and Harry Hudson, she shared that she’s been eating avocado pudding since giving birth to her son, <a href=#>Reign</a>.</p><p>The mother of three’s avocado pudding provides three simple ingredients you likely already have at home. Unlike the avocado smoothie, the pudding doesn’t require any MCT oil or brain-on. Instead, Kourtney uses the following items, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Today</a>:</p><li><p>One whole avocado halved</p></li><li><p>1 cup coconut milk</p></li><li readability=0><p>2 tsp of honey, preferably Manuka honey</p></li><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Once you have all three ingredients, simply add them to a blender and blend until smooth. Then, put the pudding in a small glass cup and spoon for the complete Kourtney aesthetic.</p><p>While tasting the pudding, Addison raved about the post-exercise breakfast, and Kourtney declared, “you either love it, or you hate it.” Shortly after the TikToker’s video, many of her and the Poosh founder’s fans had differing thoughts on the recipe.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I made Kourtney Kardashian’s avocado pudding today..... hated it !!</p>— raven shai (@PeltierRaven) <a href=#>February 6, 2021</a></figure><p>Well, at least Kourtney says the avocado smoothie and pudding make her feel great.
