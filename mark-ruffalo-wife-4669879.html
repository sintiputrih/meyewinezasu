I don’t know if I would have made it without her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mark-Ruffalo-Wife-Sunrise-Cogney-ss-post.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>As Mark celebrates a Golden Globe Award nomination and possible win in the Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture for his work in Poor Things tonight, find out more about Sunrise and her commitment to him below!</p><h2><strong>Sunrise is an actress.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Sunrise, who was born in San Francisco, CA often goes by the name Sunny, has appeared in various films and television series, including 100 Centre Street,&nbsp;Campfire Stories,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Line of Fire. She also starred alongside Mark in 2003’s The Cut.</p><h2><strong>Sunrise and Mark share three children.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>After meeting in 1998, the lovebirds got married in 2000 and welcomed their first child, <strong>Keen</strong>, a year later. Their daughter <strong>Bella</strong> was then born in 2005 before their third child, <strong>Odette</strong> was born in 2007. Sunrise once told WWD that she made sure to spend most of her time with her kids when they were younger because she knew it was important.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“I had a woman once tell me, ‘You know, Sunrise, you’ll always get a second chance at your career, but you’ll never get a second chance with your children,’” she explained to the outlet when discussing her priorities as a mother.</p><h2><strong>Sunrise is an entrepreneur.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>In 2017, Sunrise opened boutique store called Sunny’s Callicoon Pop in Callicoon, New York, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PureWow.com</a>. Although the outlet claims the store no longer exists, Sunrise still runs an online version of the business. Its <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>website</a> states that the store sells “an eclectic range of antiques from 19th century east lake to midcentury modern, homewares and unforgettable gifts.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Before Sunny’s Callicoon Pop, Sunrise owned a shop called Kaviar and Kind in Los Angeles, CA. She discussed her retail plans in an interview with WWD in 2017. “I always knew I’d sort of find my way to retail — it’s where I find my joy … being surrounded by beautiful things,” she said. “There are things that people can find scary or sad that I find quite beautiful. I can appreciate a cobweb.”</p><h2><strong>Sunrise made a virtual appearance at the 2021 Golden Globe Awards.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-18>The supportive spouse appeared on video, which can be seen above, with two of her and Mark’s three children when he won an award during the ceremony. They were all smiles while sitting with the talented star and when he shared the post to Instagram, he made sure to thank them in the caption. “Thanks to my family who lets me off and bring these crazy people home and they have to live with all these years. Thank you, guys,” he sweetly said while turning to them during his speech.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>It’s unclear whether or not she’ll join Mark for the 2024 Golden Globe Awards ceremony in Los Angeles on January 7, but we can’t wait to find out!</p><h2><strong>Sunrise and Mark have a loving relationship that they often share on social media.</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mark-Ruffalo-Wife-Sunrise-Cogney-ss-post3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-20>The husband and wife are always giving each other shout-outs on special days, like birthdays and anniversaries, and in special moments. “<span class="_7UhW9 xLCgt MMzan KV-D4 se6yk T0kll">Sunny.
