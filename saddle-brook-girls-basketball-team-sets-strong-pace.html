The Falcons play an unselfish ball that helped them to a strong start, White said."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Both downplayed their personal achievements while promoting team success.</p><p>"I'm not really focusing on it because it will get in my head too much," Brooks said. "I just try to score as much as I can."</p><p>Smedlie said she thinks the second time through the schedule they'll do even better and avenge some prior losses.</p><p>Saddle Brook's only two defeats came against Hasbrouck Heights and St. Mary's.</p><p>Seniors Tori Lipari and Karisa Quimby, junior Jamie Latona and sophomores Asia Rivera and Tara Taylor help round out the roster for the Falcons.</p><p>The added experience has made all the difference, Quimby said.</p><p>"I think we have all-around great performers," she said.
