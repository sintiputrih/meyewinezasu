"Like looking over into hell with the lid taken off."</p><p>At that time, the Pennsylvania city was becoming one of the booming industrial capitals of the United States. But about 100 years later, it would become one of many cities in the country's "Rust Belt" to fall victim to deindustrialization.</p><p>These cities, which include Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, and many others, are not necessarily grouped together by geography but by industry. For decades, they thrived as the nation's powerhouses, producing materials like steel, rubber, and coal, and reaping the economic benefits.</p><p>But the boon times would come to an end. Starting in the 1950s and 1960s, as the country drifted away from industrialization, many of these urban centers were left in the dust. Grand houses and main streets were left empty as populations plummeted and local economies declined, and cities like Flint, Youngstown, and Akron have struggled to regain their former glory.</p><p>In the gallery above, see how deindustrialization changed Rust Belt cities and towns across the nation and, below, see how depopulation, urban decay, and rising crime rates came to grip large swaths of the United States.</p><h2>How American Industrialization Powered Cities</h2><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-452408 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/vehicle-city.jpeg alt="Rust Belt" width=900 height=566 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-452408 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Public Domain</span><span class=caption-body>Flint, Michigan was once known as "Vehicle City" thanks to its booming buggy industry, followed by its auto industry.</span></p><p>In the beginning, there was nothing rusty about the Rust Belt at all. At the turn of the 20th century, cities like St. Louis and Cleveland thrived, seemingly blessed by their proximity to important waterways. In the early 1900s, St. Louis was America's fourth largest city and would host the <a href=# rel=noopener>World's Fair in 1904</a>. Cleveland would become the fifth largest by the 1920s.</p><p>Meanwhile, the nascent automobile industry brought riches to cities like Detroit, Flint, and Akron. Detroit, where Henry Ford built his first car in 1896, was dubbed "Motor City." Flint, where General Motors was founded in 1908, was known as "Vehicle City." And Akron, with its tire companies, including Goodyear (founded in 1898), earned the moniker "Rubber City."</p><p>Other cities were powered by steel or coal. Pittsburgh, for example, had both coal and iron ore at its fingertips, and became the center of the U.S. steel industry. In 1901, the nation's leading steel companies merged to create U.S. Steel, an industrial behemoth. <a href=# rel=noopener>CNN</a> reports that that company was initially worth more than $1 billion, or double the entire U.S. budget for 1901.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-452413 alt="Terminal Tower In Cleveland" width=800 height=649 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/terminal-tower-in-cleveland.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-452413 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Library of Congress</span><span class=caption-body>Terminal Tower in Cleveland was briefly the second tallest building in the world.</span></p><p>Flush and ambitious, many of these cities tackled grand projects. Cleveland built its Terminal Tower in the 1920s, which briefly stood as the second tallest building in the world. In Buffalo, the D.S. Morgan building —&nbsp;built in the 1890s —&nbsp;included an observation tower that wowed visitors.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Western New York History</a>, visitors enjoyed:</p><p>"the highest point in the city from which to view the grandest panorama the eye ever dwelt upon — the entire city at a glance, Lake Erie, the harbor, the beautiful Niagara majestically wending its way... the entire Niagara region, Grand and Navy islands and a goodly portion of Canada, distinctly visible to naked eye on clear days... Fifteen minutes on the Tower will do more to geographically locate any objective point than weeks of walk or ride around the city."</p><p>But the good times would not last. Though World War II bolstered economies across the future Rust Belt, the need for materials was fleeting. Industrial cities across the country started to falter in the second half of the 20th century as deindustrialization, depopulation, and urban decay crept in.</p><h2>The Downfall Of The Rust Belt</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-454689 alt="Campbell Ohio In The Rust Belt" width=900 height=713 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/campbell-ohio.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-454689 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Stephen Shore, image from Steel Town (MACK, 2021).

While in the city, he critiqued then-President Ronald Reagan's position on trade, especially as it pertained to the steel industry. The president's policies, Mondale declared, were "turning our industrial Midwest into a rust bowl."</p><p>This was the first time that anyone had uttered such a phrase. But it described a phenomenon that had been creeping across the country since the 1950s.</p><p>Foreign competition, high labor costs, new technology that replaced jobs once performed by people, corporate greed, and trade policies had brought former industrial hubs like Youngstown and Flint to their knees.

And sometimes the decline was shockingly stark. In Cleveland, for example, the city's former "Millionaires' Row" in East Cleveland emptied out. In the 1950s, the suburb had 40,000 people; today, there are less than 14,000 living there. The city was also wracked by ecological disasters, like the <a href=# rel=noopener>Cuyahoga River Fire</a> of 1969, which showed the high price the city paid for being a manufacturing hub.</p><p>Overall, the city of Cleveland shrank from 914,808 people in 1950 to roughly 360,000 in 2022. And every decade, the city seems to lose more people.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-454690 alt="Men In Campbell Ohio" width=900 height=713 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/men-in-campbell-ohio.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-454690 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Stephen Shore, image from Steel Town (MACK, 2021).

And as workers emptied out of the cities to find money elsewhere, abandoned bowling alleys, aquariums, malls, factories, businesses, homes, and other buildings spread across the urban landscapes like a disease.</p><p>That said, some remaining residents of these cities are pushing back against the negativity surrounding their hometowns. Instead of the Rust Belt, they prefer terms like the "Trust Belt" and the "New American Heartland," according to <a href=# rel=noopener>TIME</a>.

"Rent goes up. They are developing those new apartments or rehabbing that new house for people who make the higher income. And it's pushing people out."</p><p>As such, the path ahead for Rust Belt cities like Detroit is still unclear.
