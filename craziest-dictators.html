The question of whether Saddam Hussein was insane will likely be debated by historians for many years. Former Iraqi official Tariq Aziz, once the foreign minister and deputy premier under Hussein, has gone on the record to say that the President of Iraq was mentally unstable when he decided to invade Kuwait in 1990.
