His brother Jimmy isn’t featured at all, and the logo on the back simply says “Jey Uso.” The graphic on the front says: “Imma Get ‘Em,” which is something that Jey has said to Roman Reigns.</p><p>We’ll have to see if this is the first of many pieces of merchandise to come for Jey Uso. This certainly gives the impression that WWE will continue pushing Jey Uso while Jimmy Uso recovers from injury.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure><p>November 24, 2020 8:32 am</p><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
