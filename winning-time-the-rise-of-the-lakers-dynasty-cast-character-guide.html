While the visual style and experimental editing choices may be a bit distracting for the average viewer, the writing and storytelling prowess of showrunner <strong>Max Borenstein</strong> truly shines in what has so far been a hilarious and creative take on one of basketball's most famous periods.<strong><a href=#>Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty</a> </strong>tells the tale of the legendary "Showtime" era of the Los Angeles basketball team, most specifically focusing on team owner <strong>Jerry Buss</strong> and beloved point guard <strong>Earvin "Magic" Johnson</strong>. The series takes a stylized glimpse into the various figures who would not only shape the LA Lakers into a champion basketball club but also save the once dying NBA league as a whole.Winning Time is a massive show with a gigantic cast of characters, very much serving as an ensemble affair that constantly switches focus to the various members of its vast cast. Due to this, it can be easy for even die-hard Laker fans to lose track of whose who, meaning it's even more of a challenge for those who are discovering this crucial part of sports history for the very first time.Luckily Collider has you covered, with a comprehensive guide to every character guide to the characters of Winning Time as well as the acting talent behind them. We'll avoid spoilers as much as we can, but given that the show is based on true events there may be some minor details given away here and there that may or may not appear in the season.<img alt=Quincy-Isaiah-Solomon-Hughes-in-Winning-Time-The-Rise-of-the-Lakers-Dynasty height=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Quincy-Isaiah-Solomon-Hughes-in-Winning-Time-The-Rise-of-the-Lakers-Dynasty.jpg width=1200 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="'Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty' Trailer Reveals John C.

Reilly</strong> have had a close working relationship together ever since McKay's pre-<strong>Big Short</strong> comedy days, with humorous classics like <strong>Talladega Nights</strong> and <strong>Step Brothers</strong>. While Winning Time certainly does incorporate humor in its tone, Reilly's performance as the owner of the Lakers makes for more than just simple comic relief.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jerry Buss had an interesting career long before he bought the Los Angeles basketball team. Buss graduated with a degree in chemistry, but quickly found himself enthralled by real estate and property development, even at one time becoming the owner of the famous Chrysler building. He eventually forfeited ownership of the Chicago landmark to purchase the Lakers, and if that wasn't a risky enough move, he also bought the Los Angles Kings and the Forum Arena. The Lakers are still by far his most famous investment, partially due to how poor the idea of purchase was due to the poor performance of the team at the time.</p><p>Casting Buss proved to be a challenge for the Winning Time crew early on in the show's production. <strong>Knives Out</strong> star <a href=#><strong>Michael Shannon</strong></a> was initially cast but couldn't find himself engaging with the show's constant breaking of the fourth wall. Then, when Reilly was cast, it reportedly completely strained the long friendship between Adam McKay and his long-time partner <a href=#><strong>Will Ferrell</strong></a>, who supposedly wanted the part. Regardless, Reilly so far not only looks the part but also displays that marvelous charisma that the iconic philanthropist was so well known for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=quincy-isaiah-as-magic-johnson>Quincy Isaiah as Magic Johnson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/John-C-Reilly-Stephen-Adly-Guirgis-and-Shaylaren-Hilton-in-Winning-Time.jpg><p>Most would probably expect that one of the most revered basketball players of all time to be played by an actor of at least close reputation, yet Winning Time made an admirably bold decision by casting a true unknown with <a href=#><strong>Quincy Isaiah</strong></a>. This has so far proved to be a masterstroke of brilliance as Isiah seems like a true star in the making.</p><p>Born Earvin Johnson Jr., Magic went pro by joining the Lakers at the exceedingly young age of 20 years old as the number one overall draft pick. Despite his young age, Johnson would become the tallest point guard in NBA history at a whopping six-foot-nine. Whether it was his awesome size or his equally awesome skill at the game of basketball, Johnson tenure with the team featured an impressive five championship wins, skyrocketing the team into the stuff of legends yet again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, Johnson's career came to a halt after he was diagnosed with HIV, following an impromptu and heartbreaking retirement. Johnson did return to play in the NBA on two separate returns, but it was understandably impossible to top the incredible dynasty that was spawned when he first joined the Lakers.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="Adam McKay Reveals Why He and Will Ferrell Split">John C.

Their relationship became a further challenge when Magic was drafted to the Lakers and would have to move miles away from Cookie. Still, they ultimately made it work and were married in 1991. Shortly after, Johnson retired due to his HIV diagnosis, but despite this Cookie has stood by her husband and supported him through every step of their decades-long journey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jason-clarke-as-jerry-west>Jason Clarke as Jerry West</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/winning-time-hbo.jpg><p><strong>Zero Dark Thirty</strong> star <a href=#><strong>Jason Clarke</strong></a> has thus far delivered a career-best performance as a crucially important player and coach of Lakers' past. Before <strong>LeBron James</strong>, before <strong>Kobe Bryant</strong>, and before Magic Johnson, the name that popped into the heads of any hardcore Laker fan as the player to beat all players was <strong>Jerry West</strong>.</p><p>A player so beloved that his silhouette would forever be burned into history as the template for the NBA logo, West was and is a massive part of professional basketball history. West played with the Lakers before the team made the move to the LA area, and joined the team in almost every finals tournament in the NBA despite commonly coming up short against their arch-rivals, the Boston Celtics. After he retired, West still continued in the game by taking on the role of head coach of the team, before eventually becoming a scout and then general manager for the Lakers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite Clarke's incredible performance in the role, <a href=#><strong>Jerry West's portrayal</strong></a> here has come under some criticism from fans, stating that he comes off as far more mean-spirited and full of far more rage than what his colleagues remember. That may very well be the case as Hollywood loves to romanticize true stories, it's still widely known that West was an impeccable perfectionist and took loss and conflict to heart, and the show will probably portray him in a much more positive light as the show progresses.</p><h2 id=devaughn-nixon-as-norm-nixon>DeVaughn Nixon as Norm Nixon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/jason-clarke-chappaquiddick.png><p>Another NBA all-star who seemingly gets a more negative treatment thus far is <strong>Norm Nixon</strong>, who initially is set up as an antagonistic/bully character in the premiere episode. Much like West, though, it's likely his character will have a redemption arc that shows the basketball player in a more positive sense, with the biggest evidence that Nixon is being played by his own flesh and blood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>DeVaughn Nixon</strong>, Norm Nixon's own son, plays the two time NBA champion, and the team's all-star point guard before Magic took center stage. It's easy to imagine that Johnson and Nixon butted heads from time to time given that Nixon was the experienced veteran and Johnson was still a rookie, so it should be quite interesting to see how they're rivalry evolves over the course of the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="10 Best Sports Shows If You Like HBO's 'Winning Time'">10 Best Sports Shows If You Like HBO's 'Winning Time'</a></span></p><h2 id=gaby-hoffmann-as-claire-rothman>Gaby Hoffmann as Claire Rothman</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/DeVaughn-Nixon.jpg><p>Thus far, most of the individuals discussed have a more direct involvement in the game of basketball itself, but the venue for the LA Lakers was easily just as important. That's where <strong>Claire Rothman</strong> comes in, played by <strong>Gaby Hoffmann</strong>, who some sports entertainment fans may recognize as young Karin Kinsella from <a href=#><strong>Field of Dreams</strong></a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rothman was the general manager for the Forum, the stadium that the Lakers played in before the team moved venues in 1999. The Forum, like the Los Angeles team, had fallen upon somewhat rough times, with the basketball games being the only source of revenue for the stadium. Massive centers like this needed far more diverse shows to fill it during the off-season, such as concerts and other sporting events, and Rothman was the main woman behind some of the more crucial decisions that brought the Forum back into relevancy.</p><h2 id=hadley-robinson-as-jeanie-buss>Hadley Robinson as Jeanie Buss</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/winning-time.jpg><p><strong>Hadley Robinson</strong>'s role in Winning Time has been minor thus far, but the <a href=#><strong>I'm Thinking of Ending Things</strong></a> star will no doubt be a constant presence in the series given that <strong>Jeanie Buss</strong> would go on to follow in her father's footsteps and own the team, and still own them to this very day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As you may have guessed, Jeanie is Jerry Buss's daughter, and at a young age, she showed a keen, voracious interest in being her father's right-hand woman. Sure, things may have started out small, working closely with Claire Rothman to come up with ideas for getting more people into the stadium, but her constant dedication to helping her father and improving the team did not go unnoticed, hence why she is now in the position that she's in today. She continues her family's legacy as a sports industry mogul by owning a wide variety of franchises outside of the Lakers themselves.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="'Winning Time': Sally Field & Hadley Robinson on Being Lakers Fans and Playing Real-Life Legends">'Winning Time': Sally Field & Hadley Robinson on Being Lakers Fans and Playing Real-Life Legends</a></span></p><h2 id=solomon-hughes-as-kareem-abdul-jabbar>Solomon Hughes as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/winning-time-hadley-robinson-02.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is another case of an acting newcomer filling the massive shoes of a sports icon.

Abdul-Jabbar to this very day is one of the most celebrated players in basketball history, maintaining the record of most points scored with an absolutely staggering 38,318 points. His series of records made him a natural fit as the team's leader, with the other team members constantly looking to him for guidance both off and on the court as their captain.</p><h2 id=sally-field-as-jessie-buss>Sally Field as Jessie Buss</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/winning-time-quincy-isaiah-solomon-hughes-02.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Two-time Academy Award-winner <a href=#><strong>Sally Field</strong></a> adds her infectious charm to the series as Jerry Buss's mother, <strong>Jessie Buss</strong>.</p><p>Jessie Buss was often credited by Jerry Buss as a huge influence on the man her son would ultimately become. Not only was she Jerry's primary parental guardian, but she made his education a major priority to prepare him to not only survive the real world but potentially run it.

He eventually secured a broadcasting gig as a correspondent for his team, but perhaps even he couldn't predict the vital role he would ultimately have on his former team beyond simple reporting.</p><p>After Jerry West stepped away from coaching, Jerry Buss was in a mad dash to find a replacement. The resulting saga is one too insane and unpredictable to spoil here, but ultimately the end result was assistant coach <strong>Paul Westhead</strong> getting promoted to head coach.

He was only the head coach for a few years but was never remembered as a horrible playmaker in any sense.

He's held court-side seats ever since the early 1970s and has rarely missed a game, even getting into several fights and arguments with both players and officials as if he were actually a coach himself. His enthusiasm and love for the team has even earned Nicholson the status as the team's unofficial mascot, and hopefully <strong>Max E. Williams</strong> will do the larger than life's star infectious personality some justice.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51kxKq6zaKloGWknrqmedOhnGaqmaiybrvFZquhnV2hrqyx0axknbGelsC1xYycmKysXZi1or7AnKueql2cwqqwxGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tarek-fahmy-parents-age-wiki-bio-facts-on-lola-consuelos-boyfriend.html><span>←</span><span>Tarek Fahmy Parents, Age, Wiki, Bio Facts on Lola Consuelos Boyfriend</span></a>
