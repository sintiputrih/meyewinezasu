It would be really helpful if you could spread the news, especially if you have any connections in the Camden or Kensington neighborhoods of London.</p><p>Despite the fact that I am aware that the majority of this group’s activities take place in Philadelphia, I am seeking for potential connections for a friend of a friend who lives in the area. It has been ten days since she was last seen, and the house in Camden, New Jersey, was the last location where her phone was tracked via location services.</p><p>Our anxiety for her well-being is just growing stronger by the day. Her immediate relatives as well as her closest acquaintances are really concerned about her health. If you see her or anyone who even remotely resembles her, please let me know by sending a private message to my Facebook account.</p><p>Because I will be going through the filtered messages, even if we aren’t friends on Facebook, our communications will still be visible to me. You also have the option of contacting the police station that serves Haddon Township. We would be incredibly thankful for anything that would be of use, but information from anyone who might be aware of other Camden-centric organizations that are similar to this one that might be beneficial for posting her in would be especially appreciated. I am grateful that you could make it today.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwr8Ctn6WdlaN6rq%2FGq5itoF2itrS%2FyKeeZqiVp8CwuoyppqWhk5p6tMDIpaNmq5WWv6S0yKeeaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-is-my-vicks-humidifier-leaking-water-html.html><span>←</span><span>Why is my Vicks humidifier leaking water?</span></a>
