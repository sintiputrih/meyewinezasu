The films were rushed and no single plan was ever stuck to for more than a couple of movies, with things seemingly made up as they went along.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>This problem even permeated the layout of Snyder’s DCEU with Gotham being moved across the bay from Metropolis in order to make the plot of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Batman Vs. Superman</a> work. While this isn’t the kind of thing that bothers general audiences, hardcore fans were pretty vocal about the “awful” change.</p><p data-characters=414 data-current-count=716 data-injectable=true>It wasn’t about sticking to the source material, but more to do with the landscape of the DCEU being changed to fit a narrative that wouldn’t even matter that much in the long term. In a way it showed Warner Bros. lack of planning regarding the whole project; Batman was rushed into the story and Gotham was plonked next to Metropolis so we could get this rushed conflict between the two most iconic DC movies.</p><h2 id=h-gunn-has-more-control-over-the-dcu data-injectable=false>Gunn has more control over the DCU</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Palmera-City-Blue-Beetle.jpg><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=716 data-injectable=true>But it looks like that won’t be how Gunn’s going to approach things. To be fair, unlike Snyder, Gunn has complete control over pretty much every detail in the DCU. Perhaps he’ll stick closer to the source material in terms of where everything is. Supposedly Gotham is in New Jersey and Metropolis is in Delaware. Fans are also hopeful that each city will be given it’s unique personality from the comics.</p><p>I’m really interested to see the cities be their own thing vs a city that’s very clearly New York or Chicago, etc. like it has its own personality</p><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=377 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s a pretty unique problem</a> to have to consider when you think about it. Marvel has always used real cities rather than made up ones, so the likes of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kevin Feige</a> never would have had to think about where each location is.</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=676 data-injectable=false>It’s pretty reassuring to know that James Gunn is going this deep with the details of the world he’s setting up. It bodes well for the DCU’s future and proves that Gunn is definitely committed to planning out his cinematic universe the right way, rather than making things up as he goes along.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorp5lkaeybq%2FRnpitoZ6ceqK6jKKlnKqVmbajuNhmm56skZ65prCMsKarpJRiuqK8jKOYpp2jYrS2us1mp6unnZ7Apr%2BMrZ%2BeZaKetKnAjKSgp5xdpLNuw86ro51lkqq2rbDIp55mnp%2BnerW0xGabnK1f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ravadee-sim.html><span>←</span><span>Ravadee Sim</span></a>
