The video costars <strong>Penn Badgley</strong> and features cameos by <a href=#>1998’s “The Boy Is Mine” songstresses</a> <strong>Brandy</strong> and <strong>Monica</strong>.</p><p>“The boy is mine / I can’t wait to try him / Let’s get intertwined / The stars, they aligned / The boy is mine / Watch me take my time / I can’t believe my mind / The boy is divine,” Grande sings on the track.</p><p>The song is off Grande’s seventh studio album, Eternal Sunshine, which was released in March.

She loves that about him. It’s mutual,” an insider exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> of the couple in November 2023. “Their relationship is blossoming. It’s effortless with zero drama.”</p><p>The pair have stepped out together at Disneyland, CinemaCon and around NYC, but they have kept their relationship primarily under wraps.</p><p>“I feel like we don’t need to go into any specifics, but, of course, there’s like an insatiable frustration, inexplicable, hellish feeling with watching people, misunderstand the people you love and you and anything,” Grande said of her relationship on a February episode of “<a href=#>The Zach Sang Show”</a> on the Amazon Music channel on Twitch.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She insisted that pieces of her new album touch on things that are real in her life, while other pieces “are part of the concept.” Still, she knew listeners would make assumptions.</p><p>“I think it’s the absolute worst idea. I’m so nervous,” she said of releasing the album during speculation about her divorce and new romance, adding, “It was scary to leave it up to these selective memory people to decipher.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaaqpmWu6J5xquYp5yVYq6vsIybprKeop6yr7CMnquhmZ5iwK2t056pZpmkqbKvsIysq5qmnJrGbq%2FUqWSfoZ6WuXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stephen-mcwhirter.html><span>←</span><span>Rapha by Stephen McWhirter, Jason Clayborn</span></a>
