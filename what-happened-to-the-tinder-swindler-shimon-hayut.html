She quickly realized he had scammed her for over $200,000. By then, Hayut had already moved on to his next victim, Pernilla Sjoholm. The pair had met on Tinder and Hayut used the same modus operandi; he splurged on her then asked her for money. He eventually swindled her out of $45,000. Sjoholm didn’t know the extent of the fraud until a reporter contacted her and told her of Hayut’s criminal history. When she confronted him, he allegedly threatened her.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>The Times of Israel</a>, Hayut was eventually arrested in <a href=# rel=noopener>Greece</a>&nbsp;for using a fake passport. With the help of Interpol and Israeli police, he was extradited to his home country in 2019. Hayut pleaded guilty to fraud and received a 15-month sentence but would only serve five months. Sjoholm later expressed that little justice had been served for Hayut’s victims. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>The Daily Mail</a>, more recently, Hayut was accused of trying to get a Covid-19 vaccine in Israel at a time when they were only available to people over 60 and medical workers — Hayut is neither.&nbsp;</p><p>Per <a href=# rel=noopener>Capital FM</a>, “The Tinder Swindler,” a Netflix documentary about Hayut and the women he duped will be released on February 2. The film will center on his relationships with Fjellhoy, Sjoholm, and a third woman, Ayleen Charlotte.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX6y1osCMoZipqJWjsqV506hkraCVYsGqusOeqWarp567pbjEq2SsoJmivK95x5qwrqxf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-bustdown-rollie-avalanche-original-by-kai-cenat.html><span>←</span><span>The Meaning Behind The Song: Bustdown Rollie Avalanche (Original) by Kai Cenat</span></a>
