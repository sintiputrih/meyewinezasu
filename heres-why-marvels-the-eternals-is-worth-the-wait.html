The year 2021 is set to witness another <a href=#>explosion from the house of Marvel</a> as The Eternals is drawing close to its release. In some sense the title is self-explanatory, the incredible Eternals are supposed to be putting up a great show of action and thrill based on the saga of their war with their evil counterparts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The bits and pieces we have heard and seen of the movie hint at a larger than life cinematic experience for the crazy unit of Marvel fans. And it's not wrong to expect more intriguing details floating about as more interviews and interactions with the stars take place.</p><p>Well, Marvel movies are pretty much alike&nbsp;in terms of their context and scene progression. But with each movie, the intensity goes up a notch.&nbsp;The Eternals is said to be conceptually a step ahead of previous stories, and interestingly from the viewpoint of casting, it’s brand new.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moving on from&nbsp;The&nbsp;Avengers, The Eternals marks the grand welcome of a new set of superheroes to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, Lauren Ridloff, Brian Tyree Henry, Salma Hayek, Lia McHugh, Don Lee, and Angelina Jolie, the movie brings a lot of power to its appeal to moviegoers who check the cast-list before making a move.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Did You Know That Mantis Is Stronger Than These Marvel Characters?</a></span></p><p>Worded as the true superhero movie, The Eternals is a comic legend from the books of Jack Kirby, co-creator of the blasters such The Fantastic Four, X-Men,&nbsp;Iron Man, and many others. Going by the records, the author promises a great deal.</p><p>One thing for sure, with The Eternals, the viewers are in for more <a href=#>superhero romance</a> than previous ones. Talking about her character Sersi, Gemma Chan hinted at the serious love triangle between Richard Madden's Ikaris and Kit Harington's Dane Whitman as according to the story they both share romantic history with her. Well, there is more. The Eternals is going to be the first Marvel movie to feature a queer couple. In an interview with Logo, Haaz Sleiman revealed he'd be the man married to Brian Henry's Phastos.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>About the first gay kissing scene in Marvel's history, Haaz said, "It’s a beautiful, very moving kiss, everyone cried on set. For me, it’s very important to show how loving and beautiful a queer family can be."</p><p>The newest in the Marvel Card, The Eternals is bringing a distinguishable factor to the whole Marvel image, ensuring it's not just another superhero movie.</p><p>"It's a superhero story, but in some ways, it's the most sci-fi of all the Marvel movies and it's the most epic of all the Marvel movies, and the story spans thousands of years," Kumail Nanjiani said emphasizing on the distinctness of The Eternals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Marvel has described the movie as a war for humanity. Simply put, a race of immortals reunite to face the fiercest and oldest of all enemies, the Deviants. Marvel's overview of the movie reads,&nbsp;"Marvel Studios' The Eternals features an exciting new team of Super Heroes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, ancient aliens who have been living on Earth in secret for thousands of years. Following the events of Avengers: Endgame, an unexpected tragedy forces them out of the shadows to reunite against mankind's most ancient enemy, The Deviants."</p><p>Celestial Aliens walked the Earth creating humans, Eternals, and Deviants. The Eternals were entrusted with defending the planet, so a war against the destructive counterparts, the Deviants, shouldn't be so surprising.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's Why Marvel's History Is Too Superb To Overlook</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmpJqqppq5tHnToZxmnaSav6%2Bty6xkoqtdrLyzwMdmq6GdXayuqsCO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./george-foreman-the-boxing-legend-and-beyond.html><span>←</span><span>George Foreman: A Look Into the Boxing Legend and Beyond</span></a>
