Hailed as a top pick, Young's arrival in Atlanta came with great expectations, especially after the Hawks controversially traded Luka Doncic for him, a decision that continues to haunt the team's management.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Young's career trajectory has been nothing short of remarkable. He has showcased immense potential to become a true star in the league. His exceptional playmaking, scoring ability, and deep-range shooting have made him a force to be reckoned with on the court. However, despite his undeniable talent, there are lingering concerns about his ability to elevate the Hawks to greater heights.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The Looming Decision</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>As Young's contract extension looms, the Hawks find themselves at a crossroads. While there's no denying Young's status as a very good player, the team's overall performance and roster dynamics raise questions about the feasibility of investing heavily in Young's next contract.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The Hawks' Roster Woes</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Hawks, aside from Young, have struggled to assemble a roster that can truly compete at the highest level. They have had some failed draft choices like Onyeka Okongwu, and Cam Reddish. The absence of a strong supporting cast around Young has been evident in the team's inconsistent performance. While Young's individual brilliance has been a bright spot, it's clear that a single player, no matter how talented, can only carry a team so far.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The Financial Burden</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>With Young set to command another hefty contract, the financial implications for the Hawks are significant. Investing a substantial portion of their cap space in a single player, albeit a talented one, could limit their ability to strengthen the team in other crucial areas. Given the current state of the Hawks' roster, a major monetary commitment to Young might not be the most prudent move for the franchise's long-term success.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The Need for Organizational Restructuring</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Letting go of Trae Young could potentially free up valuable resources for the Hawks to redevelop the organization. A strategic reallocation of funds and a reshaping of the roster could pave the way for a more balanced and competitive team. By focusing on building a more cohesive unit, the Hawks could position themselves for sustained success in the future.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The Hawks</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>In the world of professional sports, tough decisions are an inevitable part of the game. While Trae Young's talent is undeniable, the current state of the Atlanta Hawks raises legitimate concerns about the team's long-term prospects. As Young's next contract looms, the franchise faces a crucial choice that could shape its trajectory for years to come. By considering the broader organizational needs and the imperative for a more balanced roster, the case for the Hawks to let go of Trae Young becomes increasingly compelling. It's a bold move, no doubt, but one that could ultimately set the stage for a brighter future for the Atlanta Hawks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0milm5lfrLW6edOhnGaZpKGur8DAZp%2Bar5uoerS0zq6jnWWTpLu0tcOeqWaln6u2r7OMqKVmnqKkum7A0ZqcZrGfqruo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./justin-roilands-net-worth-explained-how-much-roiland-made-from-rick-and-morty-and-more.html><span>←</span><span>Justin Roilands net worth explained: How much Roiland made from Rick and Morty and more</span></a>
