<a href=../../../lucasfilm-reportedly-plans-ahsoka-tano-bisexual-liveaction.html></a>
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker got a lot of flack from fans for not making Finn and Poe a couple, as we’re still yet to have a leading openly LGBT character, let alone two, in the franchise. Yes, there was that brief same-sex kiss between those two Resistance fighters, but Lucasfilm should really get on with inserting some queer heroes into the saga soon.
Recommended Videos Thankfully, we’ve heard rumblings that they’re going to be doing exactly that in the near future and now, it seems they plan to explore one fan favorite character’s sexuality in particular.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Omoye Assata Lynn- All About The Daughter Of Lonnie Rashid</h2><time>May 8, 2024</time>

No one was more surprised to learn about Marilyn Manson's "engagement" than the rocker himself.
A rep for Seraphim Ward, an aspiring actress and self-described "independent occult filmmaker," told E! News Monday that the two stars are planning to tie the knot. "Seraphim has recently made a life commitment to her partner and couldn't be happier!"
There's just one problem: "This is untrue," Manson's rep tells Us Weekly exclusively. "He has never met this woman.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Salomon &amp;amp; Jah Jah's RX MOC 3.0 Sends a Message</h2><time>May 8, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../the-huawei-p30-p30-pro-reviews-photography-enhanced.html></a>
Video Recording Video recording on the new P30’s shouldn’t differ too much to what we saw on the Mate 20 Pro. The new Kirin 980 significantly improves upon the video recording capabilities of its predecessor, and as such, the new P30s should showcase significant uplifts to last year’s P20s. Particularly the P30 Pro will be interesting as it has OIS on the main camera module, which should result in much smoother video compared to what we’ve seen in recent Huawei flagships.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/97/>← Prev Page</a>
