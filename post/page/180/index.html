Clown hysteria has been happening for decades. Maybe people just really hate clowns.ORLANDO SIERRA/AFP/Getty Images
Late Monday evening, thousands of students gathered on the Penn State campus to hunt a masked jokester after reports of a clown sighting circulated on social media. But the midnight mob was about as successful in capturing that clown as police were in finding the one that had supposedly been murdered in Fort Wayne, Indiana.

<a href=../../../why-is-it-called-bully-beef.html></a>
The name "bully beef" likely comes from the French bouilli (meaning "boiled") in Napoleonic times, or possibly from the head of a bull depicted on the popular Hereford brand of canned corned beef. The cans have a distinctive oblong shape. Where did bully beef originated? During the Boer War, which lasted from 1899 to 1902, bully beef was introduced as a ration for British soldiers. The war, also known as the Second Boer War or the South African War, was a conflict between the British Empire and two Boers of South Africa.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/179/>← Prev Page</a></nav></main><footer class=footer><p>&copy; 2024 <a href=../../../></a></p><p>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Hugo️️</a>️</p></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
