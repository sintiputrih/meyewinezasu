Is Barbie really <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the best movie ever to make a billion dollars</a>?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tweet_1690807262074343425_20230814_072752_via_10015_io.png><p data-characters=526 data-current-count=826 data-injectable=true>So let’s take a glance over at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the list of billion-dollar movies</a> and see how it stacks up. There are a lot of frothy blockbusters on there that are merely fun and entertaining, but what’s got some substance? We’d name Jurassic Park, Toy Story 3, Joker, The Dark Knight, The Return of the King and Skyfall as genuinely good movies that are at least Barbie‘s equal. Fans of all those movies have taken to the battlements to defend them against the Barbie onslaught, though Brody will not concede an inch.</p><p data-characters=79 data-current-count=79 data-injectable=false>There’s also Titanic, though Brody clearly thinks that’s overrated:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tweet_1690818725656621056_20230814_073254_via_10015_io.png><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=674 data-injectable=true>Most replies conclude that Brody is trolling fans and that Barbie being the best billion-dollar movie isn’t so much praising it as pointing out the poor competition it faces for that honour, or as one user put it: “being the best of a list of terrible films means what to you?”</p><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=209 data-injectable=false>Hyperbole aside Barbie really is a fun ride and if there’s anyone out there who hasn’t seen it (can’t be many by now) put aside your preconceptions and check it out before it leaves theaters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJompqknJ67qHnBmqmboZViwamxjJucrKxdory3tcRmq6hllauys3nRnpicoF2WeqO1y6WgqKZdmbytuMCrqmahl6O2tbHSZpyxmZOpubp506GcZpyVl661sYyypq6cXZ66orPIp5xo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-wrong-with-danielle-kang-feet-details-to-know-about-her-health.html><span>←</span><span>What Is Wrong With Danielle Kang Feet?
