Additionally, these clubs will charge no merchandise selling fees, so artists keep 100% of merch profits. Touring is a crucial part of an artist’s livelihood, and we understand travel costs take one of the biggest bites out of artists’ nightly profits. By helping with these core expenses, we aim to make it easier for artists on the road so they can keep performing to their fans in more cities across the country.<br><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.livenationentertainment.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/OTRA-3-1024x318.png alt width=1024 height=318 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li><li><strong>Thanking our Behind-The-Scenes Heroes</strong>: Live Nation also wants to recognize all the unsung heroes working behind the scenes night after night to help make these shows happen, with more grind and less glory than most of the business.&nbsp;On The Road Again&nbsp;is providing financial bonuses to local promoters that help execute at shows, tour reps that live life on a bus, as well as venue crew members that have worked over 500 hours in 2023.<img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.livenationentertainment.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/OTRA-bonus.png alt width=936 height=294 sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></li><li><strong>Lending A Hand to Crew Across the Industry</strong>:&nbsp;On the Road Again&nbsp;is donating $5 million to Crew Nation to support crew across the industry facing unforeseen hardship.<img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.livenationentertainment.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/CN-OTRA.png alt width=936 height=294 sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></li></ul><p>“Delivering for live artists is always our core mission,” said Michael Rapino, President and CEO of Live Nation Entertainment. “The live music industry is continuing to grow and as it does, we want to do everything we can to support artists at all levels on their touring&nbsp;journey&nbsp;especially the developing artists in clubs. Like Willie says, this is all about making it a little easier for thousands of artists to continue doing what they love: going out and playing for their fans.”</p><p>On the Road Again&nbsp;is a true collaboration that draws on&nbsp;insights from Nelson’s years on the road as well as feedback from touring artists, their teams and venue operators to help support day to day life on tour.&nbsp;All benefits from&nbsp;On the Road Again&nbsp;are being provided directly from the venue’s existing earnings, with no increases to consumers.</p><p>For more information on the program and a list of participating venues, visit&nbsp;<a href=#>roadagain.live</a></p><h4>Read more about</h4><a class=post-tag href=#>Concerts</a><a class=post-tag href=#>Venues</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXVnqWarJmku6a6056prZmZo7qmutNnmqilX2d9c3%2BOaXBor5mhuaqxjKecpaufo8Buu81mq6GdXae8orCMmp6aoZ5itq%2B%2Fz6Kpnqtdo7K4ec%2BrpqCqkaJ6p7vRZpuerpWhvLG1zaBkmqqknsC1v4yapZ1lk6eyuHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./winning-time-the-rise-of-the-lakers-dynasty-cast-character-guide.html><span>←</span><span>Who's Who in the Sports Drama?</span></a>
