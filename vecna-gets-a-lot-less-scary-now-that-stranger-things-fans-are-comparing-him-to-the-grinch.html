Although, one specific shot during Volume Two has fans questioning their fear — seeing as the aforementioned shot is seeing Vecna compared to the Grinch.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=524 data-current-count=524 data-injectable=true>The entertaining conversation occurred over on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stranger Things Reddit</a>, where user&nbsp;u/CastLake posted a side-by-side image of both antagonists from their respective media. On the left hand side is the Grinch — portrayed by Jim Carrey in Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas — and on the right hand side is Vecna — portrayed by Jamie Campbell Bower. The comparison clearly makes sense, considering both characters have sinister intentions at heart, and the similar stances in each scene is scary accurate.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Did anybody else notice this?</a> from <a href=#>StrangerThings</a></figure><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=569 data-injectable=true>Unsurprisingly, the comparison immediately prompted a slew of responses from fans, who definitely found the entertainment value of the comparison and took the ball and ran with it. “The Grinch who stole Hawkins,” wrote one user — and folks absolutely eat that up.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>Eezo88’s comment from discussion "Did anybody else notice this?"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=119 data-current-count=419 data-injectable=true>Another user compared the Grinch screaming at his dog Max to Vecna’s infamous targeting of fan-favorite Max Mayfield.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>zonte94’s comment from discussion "Did anybody else notice this?"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=107 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>Another fan didn’t hesitate for one second by thirsting over Vecna and referring to him as “Thiccna.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>el-chapin-supreme’s comment from discussion "Did anybody else notice this?"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true>Despite the similarities between the two creatures, the Grinch memorably has a change of heart by the end of the movie and improves his image. Vecna, on the other hand, is obsessed with defeating Eleven and taking over the whole of Hawkins – but hey who knows what the Duffers have in store for us in Season 5.</p><p data-characters=46 data-current-count=46 data-injectable=false>Stranger Things 4 is streaming now on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9WemqeZXZyytb%2BMmmSlp6Riuaa%2F0maqnJmirnqvu9Zmq6GZpGLAtb7Ap56eql2ptaq6xqxkn5meqHqivsRmmqiloJa%2FqrrGZp%2BipV2pvG7Ax55koKqZo7Cpew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-paul-getty-iii.html><span>←</span><span>John Paul Getty III</span></a>
