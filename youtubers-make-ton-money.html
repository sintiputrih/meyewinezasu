The athletic guy was a natural at pratfalls, and his short-form slapstick comedy made him one of Vine's biggest names, with a whopping <a href=#>9.4 million followers</a> watching regularly at the time the video sharing service was shut down. His first branded Vine earned him 1,000 bucks back in 2013, according to <a href=#>AdWeek</a>, and by 2015, he was making $200,000 per commercial. "To be honest, I'm worth three times the amount I'm getting paid," he <a href=#>said</a>.</p><p>Fast forward to 2017, and Paul's self-determined pay raise seems to have come to fruition. According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Paul has $14 mil in the bank thanks to his&nbsp;record-breaking YouTube channel — he surpassed <a href=#>10 million subscribers</a> in under a year, something that had never been done before.&nbsp;However, the same year ended in disaster for Paul when uploaded a video from his visit to the so-called "suicide forest" in Japan. In a spectacular error in judgement, Paul actually showed what appeared to be a real suicide victim hanging from a tree. He deleted the video, but YouTube responded by removing his channels from Google Preferred, which according to <a href=#>CNN</a> is "a designation that helps advertisers identify YouTube's top-performing channels."</p><p>After Paul posted more questionable content, YouTube "temporarily suspended ads on his channels," a move that <a href=#>Time</a> estimated could cost him "between $44,000 and $700,000 a month in ad revenue."</p><p>"It hurts, but it's not like I'm drowning," Paul later told <a href=#>Good Morning America</a>. "I try not to live my life thinking about money, cause money doesn't make me happy."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGtjaXy6u9StrJudoqh6rq3KnmStp55iurC6xLJm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./worlds-strangest-plants.html><span>←</span><span>The World's Strangest Plants</span></a>
