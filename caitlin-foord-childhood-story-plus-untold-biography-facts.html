Watching Caitlin play at school, Jamie told their mother that Caitlin showed great promise in the sport.</p><p>However, the youngster had already embarked on her sports journey before Jamie spotted her talent in football. Initially, her mother took her to various centres to explore different sports. Once they uncovered Caitlin’s knack for football, her mother, Simone, signed her up with the Warilla Wanderers.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=caitlin-foord-biography-%e2%80%93-football-story></span>Caitlin Foord Biography – Football Story:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Starting from Warilla Wanderers, Caitlin progressed to local football teams such as the Illawarra Stingrays and the Sutherland Sharks.
