When<a href=#><strong> Eddie Redmayne</strong></a> first met <strong>Hannah Bagshawe</strong>, they weren’t even considering getting married — they were simply teenagers at neighboring schools.</p><p>Before he was an actor, Redmayne attended Eton College alongside <a href=#><strong>Prince William</strong></a>, and the boys in their class were invited to a local all-girls school to help with a charity fashion show. While the event was awkward, it ended with a meet-cute worthy of Hollywood.</p><p>“It was an embarrassing evening,” he recalled to the<a href=#> Daily Mail </a>in 2014. “I had to walk across the stage topless — I was this pasty, freckly guy and when I came on the girls in the audience didn’t take much notice of me, but I was followed by the best-looking boy in the school and all the girls erupted in cheers, which was emotionally scarring!”</p><p>Luckily, something great came out of the night — the<a href=#> Fantastic Beasts star</a> met his future wife. “I saw Hannah across the room at a party afterward and she was very beautiful and very funny and she loves the arts and theatre just as I do, so we became friends,” Redmayne explained.</p><p>Bagshawe, a <a href=#>PR executive in finance</a>, remained his pal for more than a decade. Everything changed when Redmayne was about to start filming Les Miserables and invited the University of Edinburgh alum to travel to Italy with him.</p><p>“Before I went, Hannah and I were on a sort of date — we’d been good friends for 12 years — and we had a wonderful evening and I suddenly said, ‘You don’t want to come to Florence with me next week, do you?’ She said, ‘That’s absurd, you don’t mean it.’ I said, ‘Yes I do!’ So our first <a href=#>proper date</a> was in Florence,” he said, adding that the two “couldn’t be happier” at the time.</p><p>After a couple of years together, the Theory of Everything actor asked his girlfriend to marry him in May 2014 while on vacation. “He had been planning on it for a while,” an insider <a href=#>told Us Weekly</a> at the time. “They have a very relaxed and supportive relationship … they seemed to have always known they were going to spend the rest of their lives together.”</p><p>The duo wed in an intimate ceremony at the Babington House in Somerset, England, in December 2014, his rep <a href=#>confirmed to Us</a>. The candlelit ceremony had a “Winter Wonderland” theme, but the Oscar winner later revealed that the bride’s track record had many of their guests nervous.</p><p>“She has never been on time for anything in her life,” Redmayne said during an appearance <a href=#>on The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a> a month after exchanging vows. “She was a good half-hour late. Her grandfather had to be some help from going and summoning her.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He added, “Everyone else was really stressed, but I was kind of relaxed knowing that she’d never been on time for pretty much anything in her life.” The two enjoyed their <a href=#>honeymoon</a> in The Alps after they said “I do.”</p><p>Scroll down to see their entire relationship timeline:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksqWwyJ5kq52Uoq66usRmmKecXZ2ur7rAoWSbmZeotaLDxKxkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXam2rrHLoqWeZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robert-w-smith-net-worth-221166.html><span>←</span><span>Robert W Smith Net Worth 2024</span></a>
