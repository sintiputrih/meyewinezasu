[Reference required] Dobrik launched David Dobrik Too in August 2016, where he publishes challenge films, blooper reels, and his more overt endorsement partnerships.</p><p>Dobrik’s high-energy videos, which he originally uploaded three days a week and now posts two, feature inside jokes, pranks, cute animals, Vine and YouTube stars, genuine celebrities, and numerous comedic bit characters. These videos have helped him attract admirers in recent years. Dobrik received a Diamond Play Button from YouTube in December 2018 in honor of his channel achieving 10 million subscribers. Additionally, Dobrik was listed by Paper magazine as one of the “10 Social Media Personalities Making the Most Noise” for 2018.

He spoke about the sources of inspiration for his popular YouTube channel and viral videos as well as his first encounter with Justin Bieber. According to Nielsen Social Content Ratings, Dobrik’s presence on the program with Martin Short and Yola helped it become the week’s most popular late-night series with 2.2 million interactions across Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, an increase of +582 percent.</p><p>According to Nielsen Media Research, the program tied for first place in the key adult-female demographics of adults aged 18 to 49 and adults aged 18 to 34 for the late-night rating week of January 20 through January 24. It also won the week handily over its rivals in all key adult female demographics. With five videos featuring Dobrik accumulating more than 15 million views, the program also placed top overall among all entertainment companies for the week.</p><p>According to a study conducted by Piper Jaffray & Co. in April 2020, Dobrik was named the most favored media figure among teens for the second consecutive period. According to Vanessa Pappas, general manager of TikTok US, Dobrik was chosen as one of the first 19 recipients of the $1 billion Creator Fund by TikTok in August 2020 because of “his ability to show what it means to be your authentic self, bring joy and inspiration to people, and creatively connect with an audience.” Erin Lim and Andrew Hawkins joined Dobrik as his co-hosts on the Discovery Channel’s Dodgeball Thunderdome, a reality competition program. To create the next big social media network based on authenticity, Dobrik also intends to develop his David’s Disposable App into a fully-fledged social media network. Dobrik formally signed up for Twitch to start his streaming channel.</p><p>According to the analytics program SullyGnome, his first live broadcast peaked at 47,233 concurrent views, and his channel amassed a total of 201,00 followers. Dobrik inked a deal with streaming service Discovery+ in September 2021 for a travel show titled Discovering David Dobrik, which debuted online in November 2021.&nbsp; Regarding Dobrik’s vlog, The Verge stated in a profile from July 2019: “Consider it to be Friends for vloggers. Dobrik invented the first sitcom vlog. The tale is advanced via musical transitions, a recurring ensemble of characters, and Dobrik’s laughing, which serves as the audience’s laugh track. Dobrik knows when to laugh, and it all has to do with the antics of his companions.” Julia Alexander, the author of that piece, credited Dobrik’s editing technique for introducing Vine’s quick-cut style format to YouTube. It sparked a flood of imitators, many of whom are still influencing the site’s content today, she said.</p><p>A recurrent crew of buddies known as “The Vlog Squad” appears in Dobrik’s vlogs. Membership in the vlogs’ cast is nebulous since it is, at its heart, a buddy group. Jason Nash, Natalie Mariduena, Josh Peck, Zane Hijazi, Heath Hussar, Mariah Amato, Scotty Sire, Ilya Fedorovich, Nick Antonyan and his siblings Vardan and Suzy, Matt King, Toddy Smith, Corinna Kopf, Jeff Wittek, Joe Vulpis, Carly Incontro, and Erin Gilfoy are generally regarded as members of the Vlog Squad. The cast of the vlogs rotates because it represents a representative sampling of Dobrik’s bigger buddy network.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gabbie Hanna, Liza Koshy, Trisha Paytas, Nik Keswani (also known as BigNik), Dom Zeglaitis, Seth Francois, Brandon Calvillo, Elton Castle, Alex Ernst, and Kristen McAtee are former or occasionally featured members. Speaking about the Ensemble Cast award that the Vlog Squad won at the 2019 Streamy Awards, Dobrik commented, “I think the ensemble is going to win. I can’t stress enough how absurd the nominations are, and it’s all down to these guys “Added him. “I have a group of maybe 15, 20, or 30 pals that support me constantly with all the videos,” the speaker said.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=David_Dobrik_Controversis></span>David Dobrik Controversis<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><strong>Sexual assault claims against Vlog Squad</strong><br>Seth Francois, a former member of the Vlog Squad, accused Dobrik of sexual assault in February 2021 after being tricked into blindfolded kissing Jason Nash. Francois said that as the only person of color on the Vlog Squad, he had pressure to “participate in pieces that [came] out culturally inappropriate.” Nik Keswani, a former member of the Vlog Squad, said that Dobrik bullied him and that this is why he quit the group in 2018.</p><p>On March 16, 2021, Kat Tenbarge of Business Insider revealed that during the production of a 2018 video about group sex, Dom Zeglaitis, a former member of the Vlog Squad, reportedly raped a lady who was intoxicated and unable to give her permission. The following day, Dobrik made a brief video titled “Let’s chat” in which he addressed certain current problems around him, particularly those involving ex-Vlog Squad members. He didn’t address the accusations made against Zeglaitis earlier that day in detail. Following the accusations, Dobrik lost several sponsors and supporters in addition to quitting his job at Dispo. According to a report on March 26, 2021, YouTube briefly stopped monetizing Dobrik and Zeglaitis’ channels because of the event, claiming contraventions of its creator responsibility policy. Dobrik resumed uploading to his YouTube account in July 2021 after a three-month break, and by December 2021, his channel had recovered to become the 20th most popular channel in the world based on views per episode.</p><p><strong>Dobrik’s lawsuit for wounding Jeff Wittek</strong><br>Jeff Wittek, a member of the Vlog Squad, made a documentary titled Don’t Try This at Home in April 2021 that detailed the events leading up to an accident in June 2020 in which Wittek fractured his skull and face and needed extensive surgery. The event happened when the Vlog Squad went wakeboarding in a small lake while being dragged by Dobrik using an excavator during a video shoot for Dobrik’s comeback vlog. Corinna Kopf, another member of the Vlog Squad, was seen swinging from the line in Wittek’s documentary, but when she started to lose her balance and almost fell, she asked to be freed; however, Dobrik did not act right away, leading her to accuse him of “going things too far.” Dobrik swung Wittek higher than anybody before him when it was his time, and then he abruptly stopped. Wittek was still hooked to the line, but the force of his swinging around caused him to collide with the excavator and tumble into the tiny lake. Since then, Wittek has sued Dobrik for $10 million in damages for “general carelessness and willful injury.”</p><p>Dobrik swung Wittek higher than anybody before him when it was his time, and then he abruptly stopped.
