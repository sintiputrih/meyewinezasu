When at last the fan favorite broke his silence on the matter on May 3, he tweeted that “I’m so appreciative of the opportunity that General Hospital gave me, and I wouldn’t be as busy as I am professionally if it weren’t for the talented producers, writers, directors and fellow actors.</span></p><p><strong>More:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Aftershocks of a surprise coupling</a></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“[Executive producer] Frank Valentini is a mentor and a friend, and we’ve had some pretty extensive conversations about my future on the show.

(Review <a href=# rel=noopener>the sweethearts’ love story here</a>.) Chavez is well aware of how devoted they are, too. “Beyond the people I’ve already mentioned,” he said, “I want to take some time to thank and honor the General Hospital fan base… especially the ‘Sprina’ fans… who must be the most loyal and kind fan base in the universe of entertainment.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Words fail to show the depth of my gratitude,” he concluded. “Thank you… I love you all very, very much.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The Houston native made his television debut when he joined General Hospital in the summer of 2021. But he was such a natural that he became an overnight sensation. The audience immediately embraced his character’s potential pairing with Sydney Mikayla and then Tabyana Ali’s Trina, and just a year later, he won the Outstanding Supporting Actor Daytime Emmy. That same year, he also appeared in his first movie, Tubi’s Crushed. (Read <a href=# rel=noopener>all about that here</a>.) In 2023, Chavez landed one of the leads in Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, about the Beverly Hills brothers who were convicted of the 1989 murder of their parents (but testified that they had only done so for fear of being killed after threatening to expose their father’s sexual, emotional and physical abuse).</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>As things stand on General Hospital, Spencer is presumed to have died along with babymama Esme Prince after she injected him with a drug and the two of them fell off of a boat into the Seine River. But as we all know, no body means nobody died. So Spencer and, for that matter, Esme could come bobbing to the surface at any time.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/170947_0016.jpg alt='GENERAL HOSPITAL - Episode “15395” - "General Hospital" airs Monday - Friday, on ABC (check local listings).
