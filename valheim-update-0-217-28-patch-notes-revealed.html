This patch, which should have come earlier, but better late than never, gives players a chance to goof around with Jack-o-turnips and don those classic pointy witch hats, a nod to the spooky season we all love.</p><p>If you’ve been itching to get your Viking hands on these items without jumping through hoops on the Public Test Branch, your wait is over. The team behind Valheim is working on a nifty system that’ll let these seasonal goodies pop up on their own when the time is right, but for now, we can all enjoy the new stuff the old-fashioned way.</p><p>But it’s not just about the new hats and decorations. This update is also packing a severe tech punch. Valheim is moving up in the world with an upgrade to Unity 2022. This is geek speak for a smoother and more stable experience in the game. But here’s the kicker: once you play in the updated version, there’s no going back. The worlds you create or visit in the new patch can’t be opened in the older game versions anymore, so make sure you’re ready for that commitment.</p><h2 class=partnereventdisplay_EventDetailTitle_2_4FS>Valheim Patch 0.217.28</h2>We know it’s a bit late, but this patch finally brings the Jack-o-turnip and the new pointy hat to the default branch of the game! Hopefully we will be able to change our system for this fairly soon, so that the seasonal content can simply be tied to specific dates in the future, instead of having to pass through the Public Test Branch before being released.<p>Aside from the autumn items, this patch also entails an engine upgrade to Unity 2022. Because of this Unity upgrade, please note that worlds used in this update will not be backwards compatible with earlier versions of the game.</p><p>Fixes & Improvements:</p><p>* Jack-o-turnip enabled.
