Introducing the iBuyPower Revolt
At CES 2013, the PC boutique iBuyPower announced a product that's in many ways much more than the sum of its parts. They announced the Revolt, a small form factor gaming PC that's riding the same wave of small gaming PCs that includes Alienware's X51, DigitalStorm's Bolt, and the review pending Steiger Dynamics LEET. These products are essentially about the move of PC gaming into the living room, something arguably predicated by the continued miniaturization of PC hardware, a very mature gaming platform that's had time to sand off its harsh edges just as gaming consoles continue to develop more and more of their own, and the convergence of games for all three main gaming platforms.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Did Jason Statham really voice a character in Hazbin Hotel?</h2><time>Feb 16, 2024</time>

<a href=../../signs-you-are-angry-person.html></a>
Anger gets a bad rep. Experiencing anger doesn’t mean you’re bad or wrong. It means you are human. Everyone on earth, no matter how tranquil or chill, has anger issues sometimes. No amount of transcendental meditation, yoga, or deep breathing can hold back anger forever. And getting mad isn’t something to be ashamed of. During stress, anger is appropriate.
