Actress Amy Smart has one of those careers. She has been in plenty of high-profile movies and then she has been in her share of complete disasters. But it hasn’t always been easy for the actress. The dedication to her craft has also touched her personal life. That was the case when she had to stand by her husband following serious allegations.

Recommended Videos I have a confession to make: I am a lifelong, diehard KISS fan. Hardcore music fans often scoff at the band’s blatant commercialism, merchandising, all-too-willingness to sell-out and their blatant ripoffs of each decade’s popular music genres (their 1996 “grunge” effort, Carnival of Souls, is still the funniest thing I’ve ever listened to). To me, however, all of that lies in their appeal; a combination of the “so bad it’s good” mentality and a nostalgia for their early to mid-70s efforts, which remain legitimate masterpieces.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Greek Salad</h2><time>Jun 14, 2024</time>

Do a dance, on the floor, in the round. A show isn’t a deposition; a musical isn’t a witness statement. A series of songs, strung together by a combination of managerial and commercial interests, isn’t an argument. But there’s something about MJ, the jukebox bio-musical about Michael Jackson, that definitely feels like it’s squirming under cross-examination. In the moments between its big production numbers, it deflects; it distracts; it ducks and takes the fifth.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak - How To Unlock All Switch Skills</h2><time>Jun 14, 2024</time>
