I wasn’t able to see anybody, go outside, go to a f–king grocery store. I felt so alone during that time, and that was when me and her were going through our rough s–t.”</p><p>Aside from being the inspiration behind the tune, Chase’s ex played a major part in the music video.</p><p>“[The past] is something we’ve gotten out of and have grown from,” he also told the website. “We were hanging out. We were at a dinner, and I wanted to show her the song I had just written … my team and everyone was approaching me about it. They were like, ‘We really want to cast Charli for the music video.’” So, they did, and she killed it!</p><p></p><p>Similarly, the former <a href=#>Descendants</a>&nbsp;star dropped her single “LazyBaby” months after splitting from longtime love <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Thomas Doherty</strong></a>. When talking about the track, Dove assured <a href=#>Access</a>&nbsp;during an interview earlier this month that the song isn’t “a breakup song, it’s a breakthrough song!”</p><p>“I went through a pretty intense breakup at the end of 2020, and I wanted to be able to turn that page and start fresh,” she also explained. “I didn’t want to wallow, and I didn’t want to make myself feel sadder. I wanted to celebrate the end of something and put a nice little bow on it for myself.”</p><p>No shade was thrown when the song was released, in fact, the Disney Channel alum even played it for her ex!</p><p>“I was like, ‘Hey, it’s important to me that you know I’m releasing this.’ So I played it for him, and he loves it,” Dove told <a href=# rel=noopener>NYLON</a>&nbsp;during a separate interview. “We’re good friends. We love each other forever. There’s a lot in the song that is not actually directly about him.”</p><p>Wondering what other songs we’re loving this month? <strong>Scroll through our gallery for the ultimate April 2021 playlist!</strong></p><p>Love J-14?
