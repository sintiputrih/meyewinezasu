These plans tend to be fairly pricey but offer the most perks, mobile hotspot allowance, and the best data speeds overall. You'll also get a discounted price per line when you add in multiple lines on a single plan - up to four, in fact. You can also get a saving by using the autopay feature.</p><p>Verizon has recently switched up the way it handles the additional perks for its unlimited data plans. New for 2023 is the 'myPlan' system which allows you to pick one of three plan tiers and then bolt-on additional perks for $10 per month each. These include things like a Disney+ subscription or more mobile hotspot data. We've included a full list of additional perks just down below underneath the current plan tiers you can choose at Verizon.</p><h2 id=additional-perks-for-postpaid-unlimited-plans-3>Additional perks for postpaid unlimited plans</h2><ul><li>Disney+ Premium, Hulu, ESPN+ bundle</li><li>100 GB mobile hotspot</li><li>Apple One bundle (Apple Music, TV+, Arcade, iCloud)</li><li>Walmart+ membership</li><li>Apple Music Family</li><li>Smartwatch data & safety (discount on a line)</li><li>+play monthly credit</li><li>3 TravelPass days&nbsp;</li><li>2 TB cloud storage</li></ul><p>All the above perks are costed at $10 per month and you can change them out at any time during your plan duration.

Verizon does have some other prepaid plans with limited that may work for some users, but its post-paid shared data plans don't offer a compelling value compared to its unlimited plans. If you don't frequently stream video and music, you may be able to get by without an unlimited plan.&nbsp;</p><p>Verizon has a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener" data-url=https://www.verizonwireless.com/prepaid/ data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-6361382-15733793?sid=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https://www.verizonwireless.com/prepaid/" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=verizonwireless.com data-merchant-id=1840 data-merchant-url=verizonwireless.com data-merchant-network=CJ>15GB prepaid plan for $35</a> a month that would likely be a great value for anyone who doesn't watch a lot of video on the go, and it even allows you to use that data for mobile hotspot. Even if you watch the occasional video on mobile data, 15GB of data offers plenty of flexibility.</p><p>If you're not sure how much data you use in a regular month, you should be able to check on your phone. Many phones will track how much data you've used each month, so you can have a look toward the end of the month and see whether you're using enough to justify an unlimited plan.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=what-other-plans-does-verizon-have-3>What other plans does Verizon have?</h2><p>While Verizon's unlimited plans are on its flagship plans, it offers plenty of other options. You can choose from a number of postpaid plans that let you share a small data allotment with the other users on your account. You can also select from a number of prepaid plans that include data allotments or even unlimited data.</p><p>You can find out all about <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/verizon-wireless-plans-1321179>Verizon Wireless plans</a> here.
