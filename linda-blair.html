She has a reputation for her love life, with a long number of ex-lovers, in addition to her amazing talent.</h3><h2>Blair’s Career Achievement and Net Worth:</h2><p>Blair was a dominant actress in the profession at the height of her career, and her supremacy continues to this day.</p><p>She began her career in show business at the age of ten, with the help of her parents. Her illustrious and glamorous rise to fame began with the release of her hit film The Exorcist.</p><p>Blair has since appeared in a number of films and television programs, the most noteworthy of which being Hell Night, Chained Heat, Night Patrol, and Savage Street.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unnamed-2-212x300.jpg><p>Blair received a Golden Globe Award and other nominations for her outstanding performance.</p><p>Furthermore, the actress has acquired a substantial fortune of<strong> $6</strong> million as a result of her wildly successful profession.</p><h2>Linda Blair’s Dating History:</h2><p>Blair’s romantic journey began when he was only fifteen years old. Rick Springfield, an Australian singer, is the first on her lengthy list of boyfriends. She met the singer for the first time during a Whisky a Go Go event.</p><p>Following her great success with her first blockbuster film, The Exorcist, everything about her life became a public spectacle. Her connection with the Australian singer, who is ten years Blair’s senior, drew a lot of media attention.</p><p>She added in an interview that the couple sought to keep their romance out of the spotlight, saying,</p><p>We tried to keep everything very private, and I believe we succeeded because it’s not anything that has ever made the news.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Linda_Blair_1_by_Sam_Jones-300x298.jpg><p>After some time, the romance did come to an end. Blair cites this as a factor for her split from the singer.</p><p>The only reason we didn’t stay together is because we work in the entertainment sector, where life is incredibly challenging. There are a lot of checks and balances.</p><p>The couple’s love for animals kept them close and on good terms even after they divorced. Linda Blair Worldheart Foundation, Linda Blair’s animal rescue organization, is supported by Springfield on purpose.</p><p>Following up on her failed first love, Blair made news once more with her new relationship with Glenn Hughes, a Deep Purple bassist.</p><p>That, too, was over in a flash.</p><p>They appear to be on good terms when, in 2014, the bassist tweeted a vintage photo of himself and Linda at the 1976 American Music Awards in Hollywood.</p><p>Next on her list of ex-boyfriends is Tommy Shaw, the guitarist for Styx, whom she dated in 1979. She was in a relationship with Rick James, an American singer and composer, after a couple of years with the guitarist.</p><p>Blair was even the subject of a song written by the greatest hits maker, Cold Blooded, which eventually charted on Billboard. In his book Glow: The Autobiography of Rick James, James spoke on how incredible and free-spirited Blair was, elaborating on their friendship.</p><p>Later in their relationship, Jame discovered that Blair was pregnant with his kid, but that the pregnancy had been aborted without his knowledge. He, on the other hand, wished for their love to last, but it did not.</p><p>Linda moved on to a new romance with actor Wings Hauser. In the 1990s, the couple co-starred in films such as Bedroom Eyes II and Skins.</p><p>Blair replied, “I’ve always been fascinated with musicians as a love interest,” when asked about her fascination with musicians as a love interest.</p><p>They’re sensitive, and despite their messed-up heads, they’re more screwed on than most people.</p><p>Despite the fact that she fell in love multiple times, none of her suitors became her spouse. She wanted to be married and have children once she turned twenty-five when she was younger, but that never happened for the actress.</p><p>Instead, she pursued her ambition of animal rescue and became involved in animal rights and welfare. The actress is now unmarried and lives with her two dogs in Los Angeles, California.</p><table border=0 width=100% cellpadding=0 align=left><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h4 class=top><span style=font-weight:400>Quick Information</span></h4></th></tr><tr><td width=65%><table border=0 width=100% cellpadding=0><tbody><tr><th scope=row width=109><span style=font-weight:400>Date of Birth</span></th><td width=159>January 22, 1959</td><th scope=row width=109><span style=font-weight:400>Age</span></th><td width=159>62 Years 5 Month(s)</td></tr><tr><th scope=row width=109><span style=font-weight:400>Nationality</span></th><td width=159>American</td><th scope=row width=109><span style=font-weight:400>Profession</span></th><td width=159>Actress</td></tr><tr><th scope=row width=109><span style=font-weight:400>Marital Status</span></th><td width=159>Single</td><th scope=row width=109><span style=font-weight:400>Boyfriend/Dating</span></th><td width=159>Rick Springfield (ex-boyfriend), Wings Hauser (ex- boyfriend), Glenn Hughes (ex-boyfriend)</td></tr><tr><th scope=row width=109><span style=font-weight:400>Ethnicity</span></th><td width=159>White</td><th scope=row width=109><span style=font-weight:400>Net Worth</span></th><td width=159>$16 Million</td></tr><tr><th scope=row width=109><span style=font-weight:400>Height</span></th><td width=159>5 Feet and 2 Inches</td><th scope=row width=109><span style=font-weight:400>Education</span></th><td width=159>Hollywood Professional School</td></tr><tr><th scope=row width=109><span style=font-weight:400>Siblings</span></th><td width=159>Jimmy Blair (Brother), Debbie Blair (Sister)</td><th scope=row width=109><span style=font-weight:400>Parents</span></th><td width=159>James Blair (Father), Elinore Blair (Mother)</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rp5ytr5%2Bnwal6wqikaKSZo7GiecGlmKKqXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-daca-student-loan.html><span>←</span><span>How to borrow student loans for DACA recipients</span></a>
