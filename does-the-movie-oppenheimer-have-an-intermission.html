Oppenheimer has an epic 3-hour runtime that could really test the bladders of viewers.</p><p>Theatrically released on July 21, 2023, by Universal Pictures, the biographical thriller is the 12th movie from the acclaimed filmmaker Christopher Nolan.</p><p>It is based on the 2005 biography American Prometheus released by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin.</p><p>The film chronicles the real life of theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who was pivotal in developing the first nuclear weapon and later grappled with the outcome of his own creation.</p><p>Cillian Murphy stars as the title character, with Emily Blunt as his wife, Katherine “Kitty” Oppenheimer, Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss, and Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves.</p><p>The ensemble cast includes Josh Hartnett, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh, Casey Affleck, and Rami Malek.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Does The Movie Oppenheimer Have An Intermission?">Does The Movie Oppenheimer Have An Intermission?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Does Oppenheimer Have A 15 Minute Scene?">Does Oppenheimer Have A 15 Minute Scene?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title="Does Oppenheimer Have A Post Credit Scene?">Does Oppenheimer Have A Post Credit Scene?</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-the-movie-oppenheimer-have-an-intermission></span>Does The Movie Oppenheimer Have An Intermission?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, the movie Oppenheimer does not have an intermission despite its 3-hour long runtime. This may require audiences to sit in the theatres for the entire duration.</p><p>While watching films at home gives viewers the ability to pause and take breaks if needed, Nolan’s film does not afford that luxury because it does not have a built-in intermission for a short break.</p><p>The topic has sparked discussion on various social platforms, with one&nbsp;Reddit&nbsp;user initiating a thread questioning “Is there an intermission for Oppenheimer?”</p><p>“There haven’t been intermission in decades. The Lord of the Rings trilogy was notoriously long. Not of them had it. Neither did Titanic,” a Reddit user replied.</p><p>“No. If you can’t deal with it you will just have to wait until it’s streaming,” another user pinned.</p><p>“Another thing people fail to understand is that intermission used to be because they needed to switch the film roll, not because the movie was too long,” the user further explained.</p><figure></figure><p>However, this might leave some concerned that they might need to take a bathroom break at some point.</p><p>Taking a bathroom break during the movie depends solely on an individual’s bladder capacity and how long they believe they can hold it.</p><p>But due to the non-linear storyline and the ways the filmmaker delivers various pieces of information, there aren’t a lot of needless elements included in Oppenheimer.</p><p>Much of the film is dialogue driven and incorporates key conversations that viewers do not wish to miss to get the full picture.</p><p>It is not until the final preparations for the bomb test that the film provides more of a montage-style sequence. Oppenheimer and everyone else at the Manhattan Project are shown occupied with other tasks.</p><p>There is not a lot of dialogue or new details, meaning this marks a good opportunity for a short break if one is absolutely necessary.</p><figure></figure><p>Fans also ask if Oppenheimer has trailers before the movie. Well, the ticket holders were previously warned to arrive early at the theatre as there will be limited or no trailers before the movie starts.</p><p>Oppenheimer has been shot by Nolan on a 70mm film chosen peculiarly for IMAX screens.</p><p>The size of the film print requires IMAX theatres to switch film projectors between the trailers and the featured presentation.</p><p>It is believed that most IMAX screenings will not mind showing trailers in a digital format before switching projectors. Non-IMAX theatres are likely to continue showing trailers.</p><p>“The POSSIBILITY of theatres playing trailers in DIGITAL is there. But it’s very unlikely that every theatre will do that then switch to their film projectors for the feature presentation,” a user&nbsp;tweeted.</p><p>“Just watched 70MM #Oppenheimer which I highly recommend watching it in that format. Just remember this is film so the movie starts within 10 minutes just 2 trailers no ads,” another added.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-oppenheimer-have-a-15-minute-scene></span>Does Oppenheimer Have A 15 Minute Scene?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, Oppenheimer does not have a 15-minute scene. And while the movie does cover Oppenheimer’s romantic life, there are only a few intimate scenes.</p><p>Talk of this supposed scene emerged on social media amid endless speculation and memes regarding the movie. Some fans were surprised to hear that such a scene would be included in the movie.</p><p>After all, the biographical thriller navigates complex themes, political espionage, quantum mechanics, and physics.</p><p>The rumors suggested that the 15-minute scene contains explicit intercourse and nudity featuring both Murphy’s and Pugh’s characters.</p><p>Gossip about the scene appears to have come from a now-deleted tweet by user @MovieGuyBrian. But the tweet is trending on other social platforms, including&nbsp;TikTok.</p><figure></figure><p>The tweet said, “#Oppenheimer was fine. Among many problems with this disappointing film is the 15-minute long sequence between Murphy and Pugh.”</p><p>The tweet went viral overnight and social media users were quick to express their disgust at the decision to include such a scene.</p><p>Nevertheless, we can confirm that the scene is not real and there is no reason to be dissuaded from watching this blockbuster for this reason.</p><p>Unlike many of Nolan’s other titles, Oppenheimer is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for graphic language, war-related imagery, and sexually explicit scenes.</p><p>The minimum age recommendation for the film is 17 years old as it contains mature content unsuitable for young kids. Worth noting, the film does not contain drug abuse or any drug use content.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-oppenheimer-have-a-post-credit-scene></span>Does Oppenheimer Have A Post Credit Scene?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, Oppenheimer does not have a post-credit scene. In fact, Nolan has never had a film with a post-credit scene.</p><p>With over 12 movies and 25 years in the entertainment industry, the filmmaker refuses to follow the big-budget filmmaking trend for titles that are a part of or desire to be a franchise.</p><p>Many titles offer teasers of what’s coming or a little light-hearted coda to wash viewers’ palate after the film.&nbsp;But that’s not the case for Oppenheimer.</p><p>This epic three-hour examination of theoretical physicist Oppenheimer and the creation of the atomic bomb is an intense watch, with tons of minor characters and ongoing parts coming together.</p><figure></figure><p>It ultimately creates an impressive and technically magnificent machine with very few flaws.</p><p>And with such a lengthy runtime, many may wonder if there includes a post-credit scene after Oppenheimer to learn if they can leave once the credits start.</p><p>The film wants to leave audiences on a single, depressing note as they depart the cinema, reflecting back on the monster that has been released onto the world.</p><p>So, when you go to see the movie, feel free to leave once you see those credits start to roll. Don’t expect any post-credit scene because you’re just wasting your own time.</p><p>Once the credits start to roll on this anxiety-riddled thriller, audiences don’t need to stay around.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyfmsBuwMeeZKanpp6ybrvPqZynoJWeuqa%2BjKGYr51dlrtutc2tnKulmajAqrvNaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./does-emagine-have-5-tuesdays.html><span>←</span><span>Does emagine have $5 Tuesdays?</span></a>
