These types of deaths are even harder to swallow when fans consider the death of Rin, especially when it was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kakashi</a> — someone who Rin considered both an ally and dear friend — who did it. So why exactly did Kakashi kill Rin?</p><h2 id=h-why-did-kakashi-kill-rin data-injectable=false><strong>Why did Kakashi kill Rin?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Kakashi-and-Rinn.png><p data-characters=588 data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true>At first glance, it would appear to Naruto fans that Kakashi did in fact kill Rin. However, it was not the result of a battle or disagreement, but in fact was due to Rin asking Kakashi to kill her. Kakashi was not willing to kill Rin, even though she was begging him to do it in order to save her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">village</a>, Koonoh. Rin was a jinchuriki, a host for the Three-Tails known as Isobu, and she wanted to prevent the enemies tracking them from releasing the beast inside of her. In the end, Rin stabbed herself with Kakashi’s lightning chakra blade — an attack meant for their pursuers.</p><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=185 data-injectable=false>This event would continue to haunt <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kakashi</a> throughout the show, and was a central storyline during his battle with former teammate Obito Uchiha in the latter part of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Naruto: Shippuden</a>.</p><p data-characters=179 data-current-count=364 data-injectable=false>It is a very sad tale, however, fans can rest easy knowing that it wasn’t Kakashi who delivered the blow to kill Rin, but Rin herself using Kakashi’s lightning chakra.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>What episode did this happen in?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Kakashi-and-Rin.png><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>In time order, Rin was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">already dead</a> when Naruto started. However, her death wasn’t relevant to the storyline until later during Naruto: Shippuden. The episode that shows Kakashi piercing Rin with his lightning attack is No. 345. Years had passed by this point, but the writers gave Rin the attention she deserved to show what truly happened.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6wn7JllJ6xbrfApJisoJliuKq4y2apoqZdnrtuusCrrK2nXZa7pXnWoZitZZWltrS7w55knaGUYra1eceap6mdnmK2r3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nvidias-gtc-2020-keynote-to-be-broadcast-may-14th.html><span>←</span><span>To Be Broadcast on May 14th</span></a>
