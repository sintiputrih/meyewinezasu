She carried a stuffed animal and wore a fuzzy white jacket for the outing, as her dad tied a pink rose corsage onto her wrist. She sweetly pinned a boutonniere to his jacket, as well. “Gentleman wear it over there,” she giggled as she showed him where to pin it on his left lapel. He then walked her out to a waiting SUV and helped her into the vehicle.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>At the end of the video, he included several photos (<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>SEE HERE</a>) of the happy <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>father and daughter</a> posing for the camera in front of their palatial home and one via IG stories at the dance, where she carried a white parasol. “Our first Daddy Daughter Dance! And yes we danced to Girl on Fire!” he captioned the video. Many of his 5.5 million followers on the platform rushed to the comments thread to gush over his attentive parenting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Russell-Wilson-Sienna-Dance-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>“She will never forget this,” remarked a fan, while another wrote, “He’s doing exactly what he’s supposed to do.
