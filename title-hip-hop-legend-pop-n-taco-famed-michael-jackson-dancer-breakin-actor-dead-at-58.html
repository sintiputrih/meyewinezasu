He ultimately became one of the first Mexican-American dancers to rise to notoriety.&nbsp;Starring in videos such as “All Night Love” by Lionel Richie, <a href=# rel=noopener>“I Feel For You”</a> by Chaka Khan and, of course, several of<a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener> Michael Jackson’s</a> videos, Pop ‘N Taco helped popularize popping, locking and breaking with mainstream culture. He ultimately wound up as Michael Jackson’s dance teacher for over 16 years, showing the late pop icon&nbsp;popping, waving, gliding and animation techniques.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2020/12/201230-Shabba-Doo.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>DJ Premier Mourns Sudden Passing Of 'Breakin' Legend & The Godfather Of Street Dance Shabba-Doo A.K.A.

He trained me when I was very young, at Polytechnic High School.</p><p>“He got the part as my sidekick. Then Ana ‘Lollipop’ Sánchez got the other part and we became Electro Rock—the rivals. I had never had lines in a production before, plus I was really bashful. They told me just play the opposite of my character, so I went in and did it: ‘Hey punk! Are you back for more, fool?’”</p><p></p><p>In addition to Breakin’, Pop ‘N Taco also appeared in Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey in 1991, Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo&nbsp;and the 2009 documentary&nbsp;Michael Jackson Live in Bucharest: The Dangerous Tour.
