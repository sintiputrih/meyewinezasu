But <a href=#>Everest</a> has seen some pretty extreme disasters in the past decade. In 2015, a whopping <a href=#>7.8-magnitude earthquake and avalanche</a> caused an estimated 8,500 fatalities in Nepal, including 19 at Mount Everest Base Camp.&nbsp;</p><p>And if a natural disaster doesn't affect your journey, altitude sickness just might. Once a climber reaches about 8,000 feet, they can easily begin to experience nausea, dizziness, and disorientation. According to <a href=#>Live Science</a>, as long as climbers stay under 12,000 feet, they can avoid a more severe case. But Everest Base Camp lies on an altitude of 17,600 feet, where oxygen levels are nearly half of what they are at sea level.&nbsp;</p><p>Many attempt the climb, and most survive, unlike some of these other deathtraps.&nbsp;It has, however, gotten riskier lately. <a href=#>Insider attributes</a> this unfortunate fact to overcrowding. Climbers sometimes have to actually queue in a line to travel to the top, and with only a few days per year that allow the best conditions to summit the mountain, its very popularity could also lead to its guests' ruination. Sherpas tend to fare better than climbers and mountaineers, so it's often advised to have them among your summit party as guides.&nbsp;</p><p>Everest has 7,500 summits on record, and there have been only 1.4 fatalities per 100 climbers, notes <a href=#>Gear Junkie</a>. That might sound like a lot until you read about its competition.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAkHFsbWlfqbWmecSaqa2go2K6sL%2FTZpuappeav7DB0makqK2eqa6qutJmq6hlk6G2rq6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./protein-pancakes.html><span>←</span><span>Protein Pancakes Modern Honey</span></a>
