<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Who is Dikembe Mutombo?His bio, height, wife, son, net worth</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>Dikembe Mutombo is a Congolese-American former international basketball player who played in the NBA.&nbsp;The ex-center player launched his career in 1991 and retired as a legend in 2009.&nbsp;Aside from basketball, Mutombo is also known for its charitable activities.&nbsp;Read more about him below.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dikembe-mutombo-organic></span><strong><span>Dikembe Mutombo Organic</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Mutombo was born Dikembe Mutombo MpolondoMukamba Jean-Jacques Wamutombo on June 25, 1966. His parents, Samuel and Biamba Marie Mutombo, belong to the Luba ethnic group.&nbsp;He grew up with his eleven siblings in Leopoldville (now Kinshasa) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.&nbsp;At the age of 21, Dikembe moved to the United States to continue his education.&nbsp;He enrolled at Georgetown University on training scholarships offered by US-AID.&nbsp;Dikembe Mutombo had intended to study medicine, but as luck would have it, he was recruited to play basketball by coach John Thompson.&nbsp;He studied in the ESL (English as a Second or Foreign Language) program in Georgetown.&nbsp;In his freshman year, Mutombo attended a basketball game and was able to block 12 shots.&nbsp;He spoke almost no English at the time.&nbsp;As his academic years progressed, he became more fluent in English.&nbsp;He worked as an intern for the United States Congress and also for the World Bank, as did many other Washington-area college students.&nbsp;This should meet the requirements for graduation.&nbsp;In 1991, Mutombo received his BA in Linguistics and Diplomacy.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span><strong><span>career</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Dikembe Mutombo began his basketball career right out of school with the&nbsp;</span><span>Denver Nuggets</span><span>&nbsp;after the basketball team drafted him in the 1991 NBA draft.&nbsp;The player was considered the top pick in the draft.&nbsp;His shot blocking skills immediately had a strong impact across the league.&nbsp;As Mutombo continued to excel, he created his own triumphant streak.&nbsp;He moved his right index finger towards a player and wiggled it back and forth after a player’s shot was successfully blocked.&nbsp;Endorsements came the same year he developed this move, including an invitation to appear in the Adidas ad with a mantra&nbsp;</span><span>Man don’t fly in the house of Mutombo</span><span>noting his remarkable skills as a shot blocker.</span></p><p><span>In the 1993-1994 season, the Legend was selected for the&nbsp;</span><span>All-Star Team</span><span>&nbsp;and as you can imagine, he didn’t fail to prove that he was one of the strongest defensive players in the league.&nbsp;He went on to score big rebound and block counts.&nbsp;As a result, he helped Denver Nuggets win three straight games to set off a major playoff mess and placed them as the first eighth seed to defeat the first seed in an NBA game.</span></p><p><span>For his exceptional skills in his first season, he was selected for his second All-Star Game (1995-1996 NBA season).&nbsp;Again, Mutombo pulled off his feat and was named NBA Defensive Player of the Year.&nbsp;Despite the wins he brought in for Denver Nuggets, the team didn’t give him any quality support.&nbsp;His request for a 10-year contract was denied.&nbsp;He had to retire from the&nbsp;</span><span>Denver Nuggets</span><span>&nbsp;because of this rejection.&nbsp;Then-CEO Bernie Bickerstaff regretted the move, describing it as his biggest mistake as a GM.&nbsp;After leaving Nuggets, Mutombo became a free agent.</span></p><span>Luckily, he landed a 5-year, $55 million free agent deal with the&nbsp;</span><span>Atlanta Hawks</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;As with every team he played for, in Atlanta, Hawks began to record wins.&nbsp;Mutombo led the team to many wins alongside Hawks All-Star, Steve Smith, in 1996-1997.&nbsp;His role on the team earned him another major title – Defensive Player of the Year title.</span><p><span>He continued his forays into exceptional defensive numbers with his new team.&nbsp;In the 1998-1999 lockout season, he again received the NBA’s IBM Award for Player of the Year.&nbsp;The winner was determined digitally.</span></p><p><span>The award was well-deserved, but bad news came when the NBA banned his signing move that same year.&nbsp;After a long protest, he dropped his personal triumphal streak, but continued his winning streak.</span></p><p><span>As of the 2001 trade date, the&nbsp;</span><span>Atlanta Hawks</span><span>&nbsp;traded Mutombo to the Eastern Conference-leading&nbsp;</span><span>Philadelphia 76ers</span><span>&nbsp;(aka the Sixers) in exchange for other players.&nbsp;He has put in an exceptional performance for his team, helping them go from a 95-74 deficit to 111-110 in the fourth quarter.&nbsp;He also helped the team get to the&nbsp;</span><span>NBA Finals</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;This season&nbsp;</span><span>Sixers</span><span>&nbsp;pulled an upset and won the&nbsp;</span><span>Los Angeles Lakers</span><span>&nbsp;(That was the only playoff game the Lakers lost this season.)</span></p><p><span>This was the fourth time he was named Defensive Player of the Year.&nbsp;When his agency deal with&nbsp;</span><span>Philadelphia 76ers</span><span>&nbsp;expired, the player signed an additional four-year contract with the team, valued at $68 million.&nbsp;The next year the table turned in the Eastern Conference rankings when Sixers were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs as&nbsp;</span><span>New Jersey Nets</span><span>&nbsp;propelled them to the top of the standings.&nbsp;The team reached the final and was supposed to play against the German national team&nbsp;</span><span>Laker</span><span>&nbsp;s. As a result,&nbsp;</span><span>Sixers</span><span>traded Mutombo to the New Jersey Nets when asked to help hold their own against Shaquille O’Neal and Tim Duncan.&nbsp;However, Mutombo’s time with the New Jersey Nets was marred by injuries.&nbsp;This not only limited the number of games he attended but also affected his performance.</span></p><p><span>After struggling with his injury, he joined the&nbsp;</span><span>New York Knicks</span><span>&nbsp;in 2003 on a two-year deal.&nbsp;After a commanding performance on the team, including 11 blocks against superior rivals New Jersey Nets, he was once again traded to the&nbsp;</span><span>Chicago Bulls</span><span>&nbsp;in 2004.</span></p><p><span>Chicago Bulls</span><span>&nbsp;He also made trades with some Houston Rockets players prior to the 2004-2005 season.&nbsp;In his first season with the Houston Rockets, the high-energy player averaged 15.2 MPG, 5.3 RPG, and 4.0 PPG.</span></p><p><span>At the age of 40, his team defeated the&nbsp;</span><span>Denver Nuggets</span><span>&nbsp;(that was his former team).&nbsp;His great performance in the game made him the oldest player in NBA history to record 20+ rebounds in a game at 22.&nbsp;He also helped the team win 12 more games during the 2007–08 season, completing a 22-win mark.&nbsp;He also recorded 5 blocked shots and moved ahead of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in his entire career, behind only Hakeem Olajuwon.&nbsp;He remained for some time as an unsigned free agent after that performance, but later signed with Huston in the 2008–09 season.&nbsp;After a fulfilling time in basketball and an injury in his last game, Dikembe Mutombo retired not only as a basketball superstar but also as an icon in 2009.</span></p><p><span>His NBA career stats throughout his career are as follows;&nbsp;Points 11,729 (9.8 ppg) Rebounds 12,359 (10.3 RPG) Blocks 3,289 (2.8 bpg).&nbsp;Mutombo was honored for both his basketball career and his humanitarian work.&nbsp;He is multilingual;&nbsp;speaks English, French, Spanish, Portuguese and five Central African varieties including Lingala and Tshiluba.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=wealth-income-and-earnings></span><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Mutombo no longer plays basketball, but while he was still active, he earned about $140 million in salary.&nbsp;This has helped him keep a fortune for himself.&nbsp;He is currently said to be worth $75 million.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dikembe-mutombos-family-%e2%80%93-wife-son></span><strong><span>Dikembe Mutombo’s family – wife, son</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Mutombo is happily married.&nbsp;He missed marrying his ex-lover Michelle Roberts, a medical student who declined to sign a prenup the day before the wedding.&nbsp;The athlete eventually gave the marriage a second chance by marrying his wife, Rose, who is from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.&nbsp;The lovers are happy together.&nbsp;The duo is blessed with six children (four of the six will be adopted).&nbsp;One of Mutombo’s adopted children is his son, who is 1.80 m tall.&nbsp;He adopted the 17-year-old because it reminds him of his youth.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=height></span><strong><span>Height</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Mutombo is tall, dark and handsome. These are basically the traits most women admire in men.&nbsp;As for his height, Mutombo stands at 7 ft 2 in (2.18) tall – much taller than the average American male.&nbsp;His body weight is 120 kg.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ydoKSdnZeybrnUraammp9itaq%2FjJugqGWYmraotNNmrqKelWLAsLqMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sydney-sweeney-luxury-holiday-wardrobe.html><span>←</span><span>Sydney Sweeney's holiday wardrobe is as luxe as it gets</span></a>
