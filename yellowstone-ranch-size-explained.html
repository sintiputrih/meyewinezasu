The ranch has been in the Dutton family for generations, but it’s constantly threatened by various parties wanting to steal the land from under them. But how big is this contentious land?</p><h2 id=h-how-big-is-the-yellowstone-dutton-ranch data-injectable=false><strong>How big is the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/binge-yellowstone.png><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=375 data-injectable=false>The Yellowstone Dutton Ranch is described in the show by John Dutton as “a ranch the size of Rhode Island,” which is approximately 776,900 acres. However, the ranch’s size has significantly changed over the years, with Jamie Dutton noting in the first season of Yellowstone that the Dutton Ranch has become much larger since he first took over as the family’s lawyer.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=693 data-injectable=true>The Dutton Ranch’s mind-numbing estimated size makes it comparable to America’s largest ranch. With 825,000 acres of land, the King Ranch in Texas is the largest in the United States, and houses 35,000 cattle and over 200 Quarter Horses, so it’s safe to say that the Yellowstone Ranch boasts similar numbers.</p><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=238 data-injectable=false>The lavish dwelling place of the Duttons consists of a lodge, various cabins, barns, a bunkhouse, and a dozen pastures for the livestock. The main lodge, where John Dutton lives, is nearly 6,000 square feet with a beautiful wooden design.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>How big is Yellowstone Dutton Ranch in real life?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Yellowstone-1923.jpg><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=346 data-injectable=false>Yellowstone is filmed at the real-life ranch known as Chief Joseph Ranch. It’s located in Darby, Montana, in Ravalli County, and is owned by Shane Libel and his family. Unlike its fictional counterpart, the Chief Joseph Ranch is much smaller, coming at around 2,500 acres. The Libel family lives in the ranch when the show is not being filmed.</p><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=524 data-injectable=false>Additionally, fans of Yellowstone can also visit and stay at the ranch on vacation, since it offers two rental cabins, The Ben Cook Cabin (Rip’s place) and The Fisherman Cabin.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y6sculprCrpKS7pnnRmqWcoF2otruxjJ6vqaSRnrumsI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-matt-gays-wife-millie-munday-gay.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Matt Gays Wife Millie Munday Gay?</span></a>
