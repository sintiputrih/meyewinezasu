He embarked on his acting career in the 1960s, initially taking on minor roles in films such as Incident at Blood Pass. It was in 1971 that he made his foray into the world of monster movies, starring as the creature known as Hedorah in Godzilla vs. Hedorah. The following year, he donned the suit of Gigan in Godzilla vs. Gigan and also appeared in Godzilla vs. Megalon in 1973, as well as the tokusatsu series Zone Fighter.</p><p>In 1972, Haruo Nakajima, the original actor who played Godzilla, retired. Over the next two years, there were several substitutes. However, Satsuma took over the role in 1984’s The Return of Godzilla.</p><p>Return of Godzilla marked a departure from its predecessors, embracing a darker tone reminiscent of the original film. In this installment, Godzilla reclaimed his role as an antagonist. He was no longer positioned as a benevolent force safeguarding humanity or battling other monsters. Satsuma’s tenure in the Godzilla suite wasn’t without its hazards. He faced challenges wearing the suit, reportedly often losing consciousness due to oxygen deprivation during filming.</p><p>Apart from his appearances in the Godzilla films, Satsuma also ventured into other movies such as Hong Kil-dong and Japanese Hell. Satsuma’s last acting credits were in the films “Blind Beast vs. Dwarf” (2001) and “Kawana Mariko: Sakuragi no amai mizu” (2002), according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminlKS6psDEq2Wcp51kvaa7z6WcaKOVo72ir8eiqahlo5bBtMHMmmSgp5Svtq24wGaqrqGkYq6kwM6rZJ2hlah6osCMcG1o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./elle-king.html><span>←</span><span>Elle King - Bio, Age, Single, Nationality, Height, Net Worth, Facts</span></a>
