Their connection was immediate and even led to a one-on-one date that had the nation swooning alongside Charity. However, Brayden’s over-enthusiasm and wariness about marriage rubbed many — including Charity — the wrong way. He may have been open about his feelings, but that doesn’t mean they don’t fly in the face of the show’s format, something one of Brayden’s exes was quick to point out on TikTok.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>In a video that has since attracted over 333k views, @kyliescudder sent alarm bells ringing throughout Bachelor Nation when she posted a clip of Brayden and Charity on their one-on-one date with the caption “Charity… girl, RUN! I promise he aint worth it. I hate to see him do to you what he did to me.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true><a title=@kyliescudder href=#>@kyliescudder</a><p>charity… girl, RUN! i promise he aint worth it. i hate to see him do to you what he did to me 😪😂😂 <a title=commitmentissues href=#>#commitmentissues</a> <a title=liar href=#>#liar</a> <a title=thebachelorette href=#>#thebachelorette</a> <a title=brayden href=#>#brayden</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Kylie Scudder" href=#>♬ original sound – Kylie Scudder</a></figure><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=288 data-injectable=false>During their date, Brayden opened up to Charity about being in love once before and experiencing the infidelity that came with it, something Charity also went through in her past relationship. “I have been in love once in my life,” Brayden told her. “And it ended terribly.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>“Been in love once?” @kyliescudder said, looking confused in her TikTok video. “You said you loved me.”… [Inset uncomfortable silence].&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=true>It didn’t stop there. After an explosive number of comments begging for information, @kyliescudder uploaded an eight-part video series detailing her and Brayden’s relationship from the moment they met in high school to the time they parted ways shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic. That being said, @kyliescudder makes sure to clarify that they were only legitimately together for around four months.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=159 data-current-count=159 data-injectable=false>To this day, they remain in contact. @kyliescudder even says Brayden messaged her after the initial video went viral, apparently displeased that she shared it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true><a title=@kyliescudder href=#>@kyliescudder</a><p>Replying to @S❤️a❤️r❤️ Part 1 of my story of dating Brayden from The Bachelorette 🥹🫶🏼 <a title=thebachelorette href=#>#thebachelorette</a> <a title=brayden href=#>#brayden</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Kylie Scudder" href=#>♬ original sound – Kylie Scudder</a></figure><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>During part two of her video series @kyliescudder admits that the topic of marriage came up between her and Brayden on more than one occasion. According to her, Brayden admitted to being unsure if he believed in marriage, which doesn’t exactly sound good coming from a man who signed up for a show about finding his future wife.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=636 data-injectable=true><a title=@kyliescudder href=#>@kyliescudder</a><p>Replying to @Kylie Scudder Part 2 of my story of dating Brayden from The Bachelorette 😅 <a title=thebachelorette href=#>#thebachelorette</a> <a title=brayden href=#>#brayden</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Kylie Scudder" href=#>♬ original sound – Kylie Scudder</a></figure><p>“But a lot of my hesitancies with him was that he would repeatedly say to me that he wasn’t sure if he could or would ever get married. And I knew that I wanted to get married and have a bunch of kids. So, it kind of would, like, put a damper on things while we were dating. I would kind of be like ‘Then what’s the point of us dating?’”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=402 data-current-count=760 data-injectable=true>Hmm, sounds a lot like the dilemma Charity went through. In parts three, four, and five, @kyliescudder shares more photos of her and Brayden throughout their relationship, many of which were taken while the pair were on vacation in Europe. It was on this trip, as a matter of fact, that Brayden told her he loved her, although she admits to being unable to reciprocate the sentiment at that time.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@kyliescudder href=#>@kyliescudder</a><p>Replying to @Kylie Scudder Part 4 of my story of dating Brayden from The Bachelorette 🥵 <a title=thebachelorette href=#>#thebachelorette</a> <a title=brayden href=#>#brayden</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Kylie Scudder" href=#>♬ original sound – Kylie Scudder</a></figure><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=547 data-injectable=true>While in Europe, @kyliescudder explains that she encountered red flags with Brayden, although didn’t fully identify them as such at the time. However, now that they are on full display for the world to see, she is calling them for what they are.</p><p>“And this is something I’m seeing him do on TV. Some moments he was really crazy about me and then the next moment he was just really withdrawn and withholding affection and everything. And I can see him doing this on TV where some moments he’s really smitten about Charity and then as soon as something upsets him he’s like ‘I’m packing my bags and going home.’”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=583 data-injectable=true>“The things that you are seeing on TV about his push-and-pull and being unsure about what he wants, that’s real because I’ve seen it myself,” she said in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">eighth and final video</a>.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>Brayden may have self-eliminated himself at the end of week four, but the promos for the remainder of the season seem to indicate we haven’t seen the last of him yet, not counting the “Men Tell All” episode that looms in the distance, of course. It’s best you stay thirsty, because this cup of piping hot tea is not emptying any time soon.</p><p data-characters=114 data-current-count=466 data-injectable=false>New episodes of The Bachelorette air Mondays at 9 p.m. ET on ABC and are available to stream the next day on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TGsMGMrJiinF2uvLZ5y6itnpxdorJurtGasJ2dnqh6psTSZpypoZNiv6K602aknpmeqHq6u9Slo2amlauys3nWmqucoF2ptaZ5wZqaoZ2cpL%2BmwNOeZK2glWLAornEZpigmZmjfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ultimate-warrior-stars-best-looking-face-paint.html><span>←</span><span>Ultimate Warrior &amp;amp; 9 Other Wrestlers With The Coolest Face Paint</span></a>
