He took to <a href=#>Twitter to thank the fans</a> for their support.</p><p>The American Nightmare had a match against NXT North American Champion <a href=#>Dominik Mysterio</a>. Despite having Finn Balor and Damian Priest in Dirty Dom’s corner, Cody Rhodes managed to earn the victory.</p><p>After the match, Judgment Day looked to attack Rhodes but <a href=#>Kevin Owens</a> and Sami Zayn rushed in to help Rhodes. This resulted in Judgment Day retreating. Rhodes and Owens had a few exchanges of words. The Prizefighter wanted to know the real reason why Rhodes brought Jey Uso to Monday Night Raw. The American Nightmare revealed the real reason was because the fans love Mr. Main Event and he felt Jey deserved a second chance.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNpbG9xZmKwsLDYZqmhp5SawG6%2ByKeeZq%2Bfp7tuvs6bnGaZpZjBqrvNnptmp5abeqe70WaYZqukqr2musOorKxlkaK8trrT</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./whoopi-goldbergs-ex-husband-alvin-martin-net-worth-movies-young-wiki-birthday-bio-daughter-wikipedia.html><span>←</span><span>Whoopi Goldbergs Ex-Husband: Alvin Martin Net Worth, Movies, Young, Wiki, Birthday, Bio, Daughter</span></a>
