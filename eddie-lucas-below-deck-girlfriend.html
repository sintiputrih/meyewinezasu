Unsurprisingly, when Eddie returned to shore (and to the United States), he parted ways with his long-term girlfriend.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>After Season 3 wrapped in 2015, Eddie took a five-year break from the franchise. He returned for Season 8 in 2020, and fans have enjoyed seeing his growth and his maturity.</p><p>Now that Season 9 is set to kick off on Oct. 25, many viewers are wondering about the first officer's relationship status — and if he should be avoiding the laundry room because he has a girlfriend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Eddie Lucas is one of the OG 'Below Deck' cast members.</h2><p>Eddie was a deckhand when Below Deck premiered in 2013, and he got promoted to bosun for Seasons 2 and 3.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his Bravo bio</a>, Eddie has a degree in adventure education from Green Mountain College and a background in paddling, skiing, and scuba diving.</p><p>"Since we saw him last, Eddie has achieved his 1600-ton license and works as First Mate on a four-man tugboat crew where he has learned the importance of diligence and delegation in the commercial industry,” the bio adds.
