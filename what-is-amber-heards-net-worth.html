Heard maintained a net worth of $8 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, up until she and Depp’s legal process concluded. Her accumulated wealth is the result of years of work in acting and modeling, starting as far back as the early 2000s. She’s since gained solid prominence in Hollywood, particularly after her debut in 2017’s Justice League as the Atlantean queen Mera welcomed Heard into the growing family of superhero stars.</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>Heard’s career slowed down somewhat in the wake of her and Depp’s contentious divorce, leading the actress to file for spousal support in 2016. She initially asked for a monthly stipend of $50,000 from Depp to cover various expenses, including rent, eating out, and pet supplies. She eventually withdrew the suit, leaving fans to further question her financial situation.</p><p data-characters=484 data-current-count=867 data-injectable=false>Following her loss to Depp in the defamation suit, Heard’s net worth plummeted. In the months since the final decision came through, Heard’s wealth has dropped from $8 million earlier in the year to a painful -$6 million, according to new figures from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. The cost of losing to Depp — and subsequently paying damages — resulted in an $8.35 million net loss for the star. This saw her net worth drop significantly and enter its current negative state.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZGir6a%2BjKGcmqqUqHqvsdNmrqiqpJ18</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-how-to-complete-the-mysterious-eight.html><span>←</span><span>Tears of the Kingdom - How to Complete the Mysterious Eight in TotK</span></a>
