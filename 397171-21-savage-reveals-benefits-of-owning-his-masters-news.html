"I signed late though," muses 21,&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">noting that his cousin Young Nudy</a> did the same. "I already had plaques and shit. I had a platinum album before I signed my deal. I own my masters right now. Every song I ever heard. I got a 70/30 split with my label -- I get 70, they get 30. I own all my masters."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"My deal ain't no deal where I'm like&nbsp;damn, I wish I was independent,"&nbsp;he continues. "I make more money off my album sales than I do off touring. A lot of rappers, most of their money comes from touring. I make more money off my music and album sales." Nudy reveals that he also owns his own masters, a testament to their early understanding of the game.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"We learned from all the OGs who fucked up," explains Savage. "My whole crew, we just saw interviews watching n***as speak on how they can't get their music in this movie cause somebody else owns it. Or watching n***as jump the gun and sign a deal for two-hundred-thousand cause they ain't have enough leverage. So I waited until I had enough leverage to go in and say 'I want this much money for this album, I'm giving you this much, and I'm keeping this much."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For more wisdom from 21 Savage -- who continues to prove himself as one of the game's most level-headed -- be sure to check out his appearance on&nbsp;Million Dollaz Worth Of Game&nbsp;below.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>WATCH: </strong>21 Savage & Young Nudy On "Million Dollaz Worth Of Game"</p><p>About The Author</p><p>&lt;b>Feature Editor&lt;/b> &lt;!--BR--> Mitch Findlay is a writer and hip-hop journalist based in Montreal.
