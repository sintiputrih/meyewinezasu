It’s been confirmed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the series finale will jump forward 10 years</a> to a point when the young Bruce Wayne (David Mazouz) has graduated to become the legendary Dark Knight. And it sounds like we won’t just have some pointy-eared figure in the shadows or maybe just a brief shot of Mazouz donning the cowl but rather, a full-on appearance by the Caped Crusader.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=454 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>While speaking at New York Comic Con,&nbsp;Gotham&nbsp;showrunner John Stephens was on hand to tease that the show will feature a completely new version of the Batsuit. But what will it look like, as Batman’s threads came in all sorts of different designs? Well, the exec producer confirmed that, in terms of movie costumes, it’s closest to the version Christian Bale wore in&nbsp;The Dark Knight Rises&nbsp;as it’ll have a “metallic” look.</p><p>“I think it’s more matte. It’s inspired by, if I had to compare to any one costume, I’d say it’s closer to&nbsp;The Dark Knight Rises. It’s a little more metallic Bat battle-y looking rather than something like the&nbsp;Suicide&nbsp;one or the Affleck one.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/gotham-jeremiah-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/gotham-jeremiah-2.jpg><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>Featuring the Bat-suit is a massive deal, as it’s pretty much what the entirety of the past five seasons of&nbsp;Gotham&nbsp;has been leading up to. Stephens admits that he feels the pressure, but is confident that the show’s costumers have pulled it off. He also ended with one last tease of what we can expect from the suit. And no, it’s not nipples.</p><p>“How much money can we allocate towards spending on this costume because it’s got to look good. Because you don’t want to spend five years, and all of a sudden go ‘great episode but that was a really crappy looking costume’. There’s a lot of pressure, but luckily our wardrobe department is amazing so all the designs they’re doing are going to be great. And we went with short ears.”</p><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=737 data-injectable=false>Before we get to Batman, though, we’ve still got the first nine episodes of&nbsp;<strong>Gotham</strong>‘s final season, which we’ve been told will be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">packed with fan-pleasing elements</a> that the writers have been holding back for five years. As such, you can look out for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the debut of Bane</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a proto-Harley Quinn</a> and a whole lot more when the prequel returns to FOX in early 2019.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3you9OhmKZlo528uL7Up6Weql2psqK%2FxKxkm5mkoq6vedKuoK1lo5qutLvNZmxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cma-awards.html><span>←</span><span>Cma Awards - Vulture</span></a>
