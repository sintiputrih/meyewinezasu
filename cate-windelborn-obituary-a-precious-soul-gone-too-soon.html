It is with profound sadness and heavy hearts that we gather together to pay our respects to Cate Windelborn. The news of Cate’s demise on Saturday morning has left all of us in disbelief and with a profound sense of loss. Cate Windelborn devoted an astonishing 28 years of her life to the profession of teaching, during which time she encouraged her students to develop a love of music and education.</p><p>Not only was she a brilliant Choir Director, but she was also an amazing teacher, a treasured member of staff, and a devoted friend to a great number of people. Her influence on the lives of not just her students but also her coworkers will be recognized and valued for all of eternity. We ask that you remember the family of Cate, her friends, her students, and the whole MHS and MPS family in your thoughts and prayers as we struggle to come to terms with the magnitude of this loss. The days that are yet ahead of us will definitely be challenging, and the only way that any of us will find any measure of peace is by leaning on and drawing strength from one another.</p><p>When we face challenges like these, it is important to remember that as Trojans, we are more powerful when we work together. We want to reassure you that our Counseling staff will be accessible throughout the whole week to provide assistance and lend a compassionate ear to any students or staff members who may be experiencing difficulties. As soon as funeral plans become available, we will disseminate that information to everyone. Let us get together to remember and respect the life of our good friend Cate Windelborn, who passed away recently. We are going to miss her companionship as well as her beautiful voice and welcoming grin.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaJuRqbJuw8inm56kkqS%2Fr3nOm6CtrZGnxm6tjKmpnpuZpMK0edKorKVll6S7pnnTqKZmq5%2Bku3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./can-you-burn-acorns-in-a-fire-html.html><span>←</span><span>Can you burn acorns in a fire?</span></a>
