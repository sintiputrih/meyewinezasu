But where do the Property Brothers stars live? As to be expected, they both own pretty swanky homes. And while they don't live together, <a href=#>Drew and Jonathan</a> do live nearby each other.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">So, where do the stars of 'Property Brothers' live?</h2><p>Drew and Jonathan are not only twins, but they're business partners and co-stars of their own Property Brothers franchise too. They once lived together in Las Vegas, but these days, they live separately.</p><p>Still, they <a href=#>live next door</a> to each other in Los Angeles. It's no surprise, given their history of sharing spaces. If they can't live together, they might as well be neighbors, right?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Judging by Instagram, both brothers' homes are as fancy as you'd expect from a pair that makes a living by sprucing up other people's homes. Drew's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> features lots of photos of him with his family in their backyard, which looks like Drew and Jonathan spent time designing themselves. Jonathan has an equally impressive house in L.A. that he reportedly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shares with his girlfriend</a>, singer and actress <a href=#>Zooey Deschanel</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Drew and Jonathan Scott aren't originally from the United States.</h2><p>Although Jonathan and Drew live in the U.S. and they're known throughout the country as experts in the home renovation field, they're originally from Canada. They grew up on a horse ranch and they've worked on homes in Canada too. They also aren't afraid to incorporate some of their upbringing into their projects. Just don't expect maple leaf rugs and hockey decor.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Drew Scott (@mrdrewscott)</a></p></figure><p>"We're not putting maple syrup and Canadian flags in our work, but we do include a lot of rustic features," Drew told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reader's Digest</a> in January 2018. "When we renovated our parents' place, just outside of Calgary, we did a Rundle rock fireplace that was just like the one we had in our home growing up."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Are either of the Property Brothers married?</h2><p>Drew married his wife, <a href=#>Linda Phan</a>, in 2018. They don't have kids, but they do share plenty about their future plans on social media and in their podcast, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">At Home with Linda & Drew Scott</a>.</p><p>Jonathan was married to a <a href=#>woman by the name of Kelsy Ully</a> from 2007 until 2013. In 2019, Jonathan and Zooey came clean about <a href=#>their relationship</a> after they met in an episode of Carpool Karaoke: The Series. Since then, they've been going strong, but they aren't married.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>For now, Zooey and Jonathan seem happy with the way things are. She was even in an episode of Drew and Jonathan's other show <a href=#>Celebrity IOU</a>.</p><p>Although their worlds were once very different, with Zooey being an actress and Jonathan being a reality TV renovation star, they've successfully combined their lives.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmm6hlpJ2ybrzRqKeeqqSueqO%2Bzq2fnqqjYrmqwsQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./valentina-micchetti.html><span>←</span><span>Valentina Micchetti Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</span></a>
