Kendall experienced some reaction after finally confessing to the cosmetic improvements, with many assuming she had her lips filled as well. The sisters continue to assert that the secret to their fullness is “overlining” their lips with lip liner.</p><p>Kendall, who has always been known as the “natural” Kardashian sister, is the symbol of Estée Lauder, ProActiv’s newest ambassador, and a key role in the current generation of supermodels, making her a target for those who assume she has had plastic surgery.</p><p>It’s easy to see why some people are convinced after seeing Jenner’s cosmetic transformation. It could, however, be a case of late-blooming for the actress, who has been in the spotlight since she was a tween.</p><p>It is ultimately up to Victoria’s Secret model to decide whether or not she has undergone plastic surgery, which she has consistently denied over the years.</p><p>According to E! News, she initially addressed the plastic surgery rumors in 2017. “Everything is so exhausting. Why would I have my face reconstructed as a model? It’s illogical, to say the least, “She scribbled something on her app. “It’s odd because I sometimes get the impression that everyone really wants me to lose.”</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>Megan Fox Before And After Plastic Surgery: The Changing Appearance Pictures in 2022</a></p><h2>Kendall’s Transformation Before And After Over The Year…</h2><h3><strong>2008</strong></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2008.jpg alt=2008 width=500 height=449 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Kenny was only 13 years old at the time. With braces on, she appeared an average adolescent. She wasn’t your typical teen at the time, as she was already making red carpet appearances and attending movie premieres with her elder sisters.</p><h3><strong>2009</strong></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2009.jpg alt=2009 width=720 height=1067 sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Jenner has grown a lot in a year. We began to see small flashes of the model she is now at that time. You can see her big nose and thin upper lip clearly from this angle. Her face still had some baby fat on it.</p><h3><strong>2010</strong></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2010.jpg alt width=500 height=426 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Kendall began using cosmetics on her face as she turned a year older, and her posing angles also appeared to be a little different than previously. Her big nose and lengthy brown locks were still present.</p><h3><strong>2011</strong></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2011.jpg alt=2011 width=684 height=912 sizes="(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Jenner was photographed at the Teen Choice Awards, indicating that she was in the midst of her rebel period. She was eager to try new things, and this was the year when tales about her changing lips began to circulate.</p><h3>2012</h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2012.jpg alt=2012 width=717 height=1024 sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>A little shift in the star’s nose may be seen in this photo. It’s no longer as bulbous as it was back in the day. She had to have used some smart makeup techniques.</p><h3><strong>2013</strong></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2013.jpg alt=2013 width=500 height=465 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Kendall’s face and nose appear to be much thinner than they were previously. We spotted the 18-year-old in a new avatar, center-parted and behind her ears, lighting the red carpet on fire in her typical elegant elegance. Her top lip appeared to be a lot fuller. Her contouring abilities appeared to be spot on.</p><h3><strong>2014</strong></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2014.jpg alt=2014 width=500 height=460 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>She debuted a charming button nose with a smaller bridge when she was 19 years old. Her lips appeared to be larger than before, and her brows appeared to be more arched and darker than previously. She didn’t have any baby fat on her face.</p><h3><strong>2015</strong></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2015.jpg alt=2015 width=686 height=1024 sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The model was photographed at the Met Gala. Kendall was 20 at the time. We can observe how she has blossomed into a stunning and wonderful woman. Speculations about her nose and lips continued to abound in 2015, as well. Her brows were a talking point as well.</p><h3>2017</h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2017.jpg alt=2017 width=720 height=995 sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Jenner appeared to be a completely different person in 2017. Her bigger lips, smaller nose, and arched brows sparked more speculation about cosmetic surgery. She was 22 years old at the time.</p><h3><strong>2019</strong></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2019.jpg alt=2019 width=720 height=1081 sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Kendall celebrated her tenth year as a model in 2019. When compared to her other sisters, the model’s metamorphosis isn’t quite as dramatic.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>Bridgerton: Nicola Coughlan Weight Loss Journey: Everything You Need To Know!</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfobansdKtsKWdX6Cyr7DApaNmopWju6a%2BjKmjmquknrBuv9Srnp6qqWR%2BcXyVaWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./arlene-dahl-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>Arlene Dahl Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
