Here’s a look at his journey so far, as well as other aspects of his life beyond the acting profession.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=biography-of-shaun-evans></span><strong><span>Biography of Shaun Evans</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Shaun Francis Evandi was born on March 6, 1980, in Liverpool, England to Irish parents.&nbsp;Evans grew up in a middle-class family – his father was a taxi driver while his mother worked in healthcare at a hospital.&nbsp;He was raised alongside his older brother who is barely a year older than him.</span></p><p><span>Shawn Evans may have discovered early in his life that he wanted an acting career.&nbsp;On scholarship, he attended Merseyside’s Catholic school, St. Edward’s College, in 1991 and graduated in 1998. As Evans described to Express in 2016, his college was “very academic but very musical”.&nbsp;Initially, he wanted to pursue a career in history and politics, but his love of acting led him to complete a course at the National Youth Theatre.&nbsp;Evans, then 18, moved to London to enroll at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama.</span></p><p><span>In London, Shaun Evans had a handful of roles in plays before television roles started to come through.&nbsp;Some of his early TV shows were;&nbsp;Channel 4 comedy-drama&nbsp;</span><span>Teachers</span><span>&nbsp;where he portrayed a gay French teacher, docudrama&nbsp;</span><span>The Project</span><span>&nbsp;and miniseries The&nbsp;</span><span>Virgin Queen</span></p><p>His feature debut was the 2002 comedy-drama,&nbsp;<span>The Boys from County Clare</span><span>.&nbsp;Evans would come to score roles in other movies like;&nbsp;</span><span>Being Julia, The Situation, Cashback, Gone, Boy A, Telstar: The Joe Meek Story</span><span>, and more.</span></p><p><span>Evans juggled television roles, film roles, and theater roles.&nbsp;In theatre, he had a role in the award-winning play&nbsp;</span><span>Blue/Orange</span><span>&nbsp;by Joe Penhall.&nbsp;He played Kurt Cobain in the Roy Smiles play&nbsp;</span><span>Kurt and Sid</span><span>&nbsp;and also starred in Peter Souter’s play&nbsp;</span><span>Hello Goodbye</span><span>.&nbsp;Some of his other notable TV shows include;&nbsp;BBC&nbsp;</span><span>Ashes to Ashes</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Silk;&nbsp;</span><span>The Take</span><span>&nbsp;and ITV’s&nbsp;</span><span>The Last Weekend</span></p><p><span>Evans’ career received a boost after his appointment as a young Inspector Morse in Endeavour.&nbsp;Apart from acting, Shawn Evans also has interests in directing.&nbsp;He directed several episodes of the BBC medical drama,&nbsp;</span><span>Victim</span><span>.&nbsp;When Evans isn’t acting or directing, he enjoys writing.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=wife-or-girlfriend-is-he-married></span><strong><span>Wife or girlfriend, is he married?</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Shaun Evans is not one to reveal his personal life online for the world to see.&nbsp;He is quite enigmatic in real life, keeping no Facebook or Twitter accounts.&nbsp;Her personal life is just a mystery to her thousands of fans.&nbsp;Evans’ scenes from his hit show Endeavor have included a handful of romantic scenes and fans can’t help but wonder what his romantic life might look like.</span></p><p>Well, we know that, in 2003, Evans started a romantic relationship with actress and singer Andrea Corr whom he met on the set of The Boys from County Clare, an Irish comedy-drama about a ceili band. of Liverpool.&nbsp;It was Shaun’s first film.</p><p><span>While Evans was something of a newbie in the industry, Corr had a great experience having started her career in 1990. She is best known for being the lead singer of Celtic folk rock and pop rock band The Corrs.&nbsp;The group includes his three older brothers, Caroline, Sharon and Jim.&nbsp;Corr also pursued a solo career.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, their relationship only lasted four years after they split in 2007. As the intimate Shaun shows, the details of their breakup remain unknown to the media.&nbsp;Corr would go on to marry stockbroker Brett Desmond in 2009. The couple are now parents of two children;&nbsp;his daughter Jean was born on April 28, 2012 and his son Brett Jr. was born on January 4, 2014.</span></p><p><span>Since Shaun’s breakup with Corr, the media hasn’t been told anything about his romantic life.&nbsp;So we can’t say for sure if the Endeavor star is in a relationship.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKGjYsCprdSnZJ6ukaPAbrnAq6minZRixKm7jKKqZqCZqHq4tcWeZKChoqGzs7XEp5tmmpmktLOtz6GwaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./does-joe-manganiello-stuff-his-g-string-in-magic-mike-2012212.html><span>←</span><span>Does Joe Manganiello Stuff His G-String in Magic Mike?</span></a>
