In one particular instance, an ex-employee gave their anonymous recollection of a time that Fallon appeared to be “drunk.” Something seemed off back in 2017 when Fallon crossed off a joke on a paper he was grasping and then appeared confused by the alteration after a brief interlude riffing with the audience. As the ex-employee explained:</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>“He couldn’t remember he had just crossed it out himself […] I was like, ‘Oh, my God, he [seems] drunk. He doesn’t know what he’s doing. This could be awful — this could be the end of the show right here.’”</p><p data-characters=115 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>The incident was corroborated by another staffer who witnessed it from a live studio feed, according to the report.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=644 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>EXCLUSIVE: Sixteen current and former staffers say Jimmy Fallon’s erratic behavior spoiled their “dream” of working on The Tonight Show.</p><p>“You never knew which Jimmy we were going to get and when he was going to throw a hissy fit.”<a href=#>https://t.co/SPY0ZkoXNA</a></p>— Rolling Stone (@RollingStone) <a href=#>September 7, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=505 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=true>It got to the point where the dynamic of the talk show host oscillating between having “good Jimmy days” and “bad Jimmy days” behind the scenes became common knowledge. He could be the charming and witty host you see on TV one day but berating an employee in front of other staffers the next, the report said. It was also speculated in the staffers’ self-reporting that they often suspected Fallon of being hungover or smelling alcohol on his breath in the elevator at times.</p><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=234 data-injectable=false>At one point, even <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jerry Seinfeld</a> had witnessed Fallon haranguing a staff member who was handling cue cards. Seinfeld reportedly told Fallon, “You should apologize to him,” according to one former employee’s account.</p><p data-characters=528 data-current-count=762 data-injectable=true>Adding to the chaos is the constantly changing leadership behind the scenes of The Tonight Show, with the series seeing nine different showrunners over the course of nine years, the report said. The article characterized the rotating door of executives making the chronic toxic workplace problem an issue that has been allowed to fester. In particular, the ex-co-showrunners Jamie Granet-Bederman and Nedaa Sweiss — who were active from 2020 to spring 2022 — were called out by the former employees for engaging in bullying.</p><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=269 data-injectable=false>This all comes after dribs and drabs of stories and rumors about Fallon’s allegedly problematic alcohol use have surfaced over the years, though the talk show host has previously denied a report alleging NBC executives were worried about Fallon’s drinking.</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=623 data-injectable=false>Right now, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon is on hold — alongside many of the other major talk shows — due to the Writers Guild of America strike. As a result, Fallon now co-hosts a limited podcast series called Strike Force Five that features the likes of other late-night heavyweights, such as Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers, and John Oliver.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMisZJynpaGxbq7EZquhnV2au6V5zp9kraCVYsCpu9ZmqaKfmKl6qbHRnmStoJViwbC6yKCfrWWjnby4edKtmKuqmaO0brbIpqSyZZaWua27zWaqrZmWm7Kzv4ybo5qllWLBsMTInGSwp6Kgeqa61aKpqKadmru1ec6nZKKso2LAta3RrGSeqqKWwaqvjJucoZmmnryzew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emily-ratajkowski-and-her-mom-show-off-their-amazing-bikini-bodies-w211228.html><span>←</span><span>Emily Ratajkowski and Her Mom Show Off Their Amazing Bikini Bodies</span></a>
