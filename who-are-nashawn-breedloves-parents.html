Many of you knew him by his alias‚Äù Lotto, ox‚Äù, a name that echoed his resilience and determination. Nashawn was a rapper, singer, songwriter, and actor. No one could deny his talent.</p><p>Nashawn‚Äôs departure from this world has left an immense void in my life, one that words cannot fully express. I can‚Äôt put into words the pain and hurt that I feel. He was not just my son; he was a remarkable man whose character and strength inspired all who crossed his path.</p><p>Nashawn‚Äôs love and unwavering faith in God were pillars of his life, a testament to 2 Timothy 4:7-8, as he fought the good fight, finished his course, and kept the faith. While the pain of his absence is profound, I find solace in Romans 8:18, knowing that our present sufferings are nothing compared to the glory that awaits us.</p><p>As we navigate this difficult time, I hold fast to the promise of 1 Peter 5:10 that God will restore, strengthen, and settle us after we endure this season of grief. Though my heart aches for my son, I remember Psalm 73:26, which reminds me that even in the darkest hours, God remains my strength and my portion forever. Nashawn‚Äôs memory will forever live on in our hearts, a testament to the love we shared and the incredible man he was.</p><p>I thank you all for your support and prayers during this challenging time. Please join us in celebrating his life and cherishing the moments we had with him. In the face of this loss, my faith in the Lord remains unshaken, for His love is a constant presence in my life.
