The project is a police reform group that helped the Bexar Co. DA and Sheriff get elected.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The first reported incident occurred just before 11 a.m. on Tuesday at a high school in the&nbsp;Texas capital, where James allegedly shot an Austin Independent School District police officer.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Shortly after that, authorities believe he shot and killed a man and woman at a home in the southern part of the city.&nbsp;At 5pm, a male cyclist was shot, also in the southern part of the city.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>That shooting was also linked to James. The victim suffered non-life-threatening injuries. Two hours later, a second Austin police officer was wounded by the suspect when someone called 911 to report a burglary in a home in the southwestern part of the city.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This prompted a high-speed chase which resulted in James being arrested. When officers returned to that home, they found two more people dead inside.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>By Tuesday night, officials announced that the same suspect was involved in the ‘grisly’ murder of a couple in their 50s whose bodies were found stuffed in a small bedroom in San Antonio, some 80 miles from Austin.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The gunman came to the attention of officers when he shot a school resource officer in the leg close to the football field of&nbsp;Northeast Early College High School just before noon. This prompted a school lockdown which lasted for four hours.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Less than an hour later, the gunman went to a home in South Austin and shot a handyman who was sitting in a car. The suspect shot through the window.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After the gunfire broke out, a woman came outside who was then chased by the gunman down the street. He caught her, and killed her, Fox Austin&nbsp;report.&nbsp;</p><img decoding=async id=i-3f836dbcbd59ce04 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/12/06/06/78628925-12830867-image-a-36_1701844954373.jpg height=444 width=634 alt="A man has been arrested in connection with a series of shootings that have killed at least four people, injured two police officers and may have extended across multiple cities" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p></p><p class=imageCaption>A man has been arrested in connection with a series of shootings that have killed at least four people, injured two police officers and may have extended across multiple cities</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The suspect returned to the handyman’s car, threw his body to the pavement, and stole the vehicle.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=mol-factbox-title>Timeline of events&nbsp;</h3><ul class=mol-bullets-with-font><li class=class>10:40 a.m.&nbsp;Austin officer is shot near Northeast Early College High School</li><li class=class>11:59 a.m. Two people are shot and killed at a home on Shadywood Drive&nbsp;</li><li class=class>&nbsp;4:57 p.m. A cyclist is shot on W.
