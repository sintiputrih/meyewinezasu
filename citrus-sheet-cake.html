Sometimes you just don’t want to go through the work of decorating and frosting a layered cake. A simple sheet is the answer! You can throw all of the ingredients into one pan, bake it, frost it, and cut it into squares. It is so easy!</p><p>The one downside of sheet cakes is that they don’t look as aesthetically pleasing as a layered cake because they are usually served straight from the pan. So what if we flipped the sheet cake right onto a serving platter? Then all you have to do is frost the cake and you have a simple and easy gourmet sheet cake to serve to your friends and family.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Citrus-Sheet-Cake-6-scaled.jpg alt="Citrus Sheet Cake made with fresh-squeezed orange, lemon, and lime juices in a moist, fluffy cake and topped with a creamy and silky homemade cream cheese frosting and topped with citrus slices.

It is sweet and tangy with a silky cream cheese frosting and topped with freshly sliced citrus.&nbsp;</p><p>This sheet cake recipe is adaptable and you can make it into an orange sheet cake recipe or a lemon sheet cake recipe if you want to simplify it. The frosting is made with sweet cream butter, cream cheese, powdered sugar, and citrus zest. You will want to eat the entire bowl of citrus cream cheese frosting!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Citrus-Sheet-Cake-7-scaled.jpg alt="Citrus Sheet Cake made with fresh-squeezed orange, lemon, and lime juices in a moist, fluffy cake and topped with a creamy and silky homemade cream cheese frosting and topped with citrus slices.

I find that glass pans can be finicky and don’t bake evenly. I have been using the USA Brand Baking Pans for over 12 years and love the quality and durability. <a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B0029JOC6I data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow><strong>Click here for a 9 x 13 baking pan</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Click here for a</strong> <a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B00282JL7G data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow><strong>17 x 12 half sheet baking pan</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Citrus-Sheet-Cake-4-scaled.jpg alt="Citrus Sheet Cake made with fresh-squeezed orange, lemon, and lime juices in a moist, fluffy cake and topped with a creamy and silky homemade cream cheese frosting and topped with citrus slices.
