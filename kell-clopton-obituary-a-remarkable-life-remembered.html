His presence in our lives was transformative, leaving an indelible mark that words struggle to encapsulate. The profound impact he had on us, the lessons he imparted, and the admiration we held for him are beyond articulation.</p><p>More than a family member, Kell was a beacon of faith and a dedicated servant of God. Through battles with cancer, he exemplified unwavering strength and steadfast faith, offering a remarkable example of resilience and courage. His legacy is one of inspiration, reminding us to find strength in the face of adversity. While we find a sense of devastating relief knowing that Kell’s chains are now broken, and he has found freedom, our hearts are shattered, and we feel his absence keenly. The void left by his departure will echo in our lives every day until we reunite in eternity.</p><p>We ask that you keep our family, especially his cherished wife Faith, his daughters Addi, Averie, Andi, and his mother, in your ongoing prayers. Their grief is profound, and your support and empathy are invaluable during this difficult time.</p><p>Details for Kell’s Celebration of Life will be posted in the comments. In lieu of flowers, the family kindly requests that memorial donations be made to the Benefit Kell Clopton account at American National Bank of Kaufman. These contributions will go toward securing his daughters’ college tuition, honoring Kell’s commitment to the well-being and future of his family. As we remember Kell, may his spirit continue to inspire us, and may he rest in eternal peace.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaKOVoblur8uop62nnmK8o7XTrpirsV2WerOxzJqppJmSobJuuMifnGaqlaKyrq7Eq5ydZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jerilyn-britz.html><span>←</span><span>Jerilyn Britz</span></a>
