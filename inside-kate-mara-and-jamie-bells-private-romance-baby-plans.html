The <a href=#>Girl With the Dragon Tattoo actress</a>, 37, and the Joker star, 47, share son River, <a href=#>who they welcomed in fall of 2020</a>.</p><p>Kate and Bell’s hangouts with Rooney and Phoenix go well beyond their “<a href=#>family connection</a>,” per the insider. The foursome “have a ton of interests in common,” including their “commitment to animal rights reform,” the source adds.</p><p>The <a href=#>House of Cards alum</a> previously spoke about balancing her work life and role as a mother, <a href=#>telling Emmy magazine</a> in October 2020, “I find it quite easy to switch it on and off, thank God.”</p><p>Kate explained that it has been a blessing to bring her daughter to set and keep up her career. “As a new mom when you have a baby on your boob screaming in the trailer, and then you’ve got to go pretend to be sexy, it’s kind of a complete nightmare,” she said, adding that her choice in roles has shifted since welcoming her baby girl.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Eventually she’s going to be able to look at the work I’ve done,” <a href=#>the American Horror Story alum</a> explained. “And now more than ever, I want it to mean something and for there to be a point to it. Sometimes you do just have to work for money. Sometimes you’re lucky enough that you can make choices based on more than that.”</p><p>Watch the exclusive video above to learn more about Kate and Bell’s relationship — and pick up the latest issue of Us Weekly on newsstands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaipqOesaZ5ypqrnmWdlr%2BiecCnm2aikaK2pnnBnqOlq12lv6rCwK2cZqqfoq6vr8RmmZqaqWK9ra3NrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./inside-kanye-wests-reported-split-with-model-vinetria.html><span>←</span><span>Inside Kanye West's Reported Split With Model Vinetria</span></a>
