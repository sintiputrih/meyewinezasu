Smith spent a lot of his childhood "shooting hoops" at a playground in Queens that had "no working lights." His mom, a nurse, encouraged his love of the game because it kept him away from unsavory characters in the tough New York borough. "I was not to be touched," Smith said. "They knew I had a future."&nbsp;</p><p>Smith earned a scholarship to play basketball at&nbsp;Winston-Salem State University&nbsp;under legendary head coach Clarence "Big House" Gaines, but his hoop dreams were cut short by injuries. "I tried to play for coach Gaines, I just couldn't after I got hurt," the 6'1" former guard told the&nbsp;<a href=#>Winston-Salem Journal</a>.&nbsp;"I can't say enough about that school and what it did for me and especially the late coach Gaines and all of those professors of mine."&nbsp;</p><p>Ironically, Smith's beloved coach also helped kick-start Smith's <a href=#>sports journalism</a> career when the player/columnist served up his first hot take for the college newspaper, urging the aging&nbsp;<a href=#>basketball Hall-of-Famer</a> to step down amid alleged concerns over his health. "I told him, 'Coach, I'm scared,"&nbsp; Smith recalled to the <a href=#>The Undefeated</a>. "I'm not going to let you drop dead on the sideline.'"&nbsp;The controversial op-ed had the school's chancellor calling for Smith to be expelled, but Smith claims that Gaines told them to "leave him [Smith] alone."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmam1la4Fye9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd50q2cqaCVo3qiedKmoK2gXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kiara-romero-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Kiara Romero Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
