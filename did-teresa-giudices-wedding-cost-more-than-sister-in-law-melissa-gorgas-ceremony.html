According to Us Weekly, Melissa and Joe weren't happy that people spread allegations that Melissa had been unfaithful to Joe and Teresa was aware of that.</p><p>Back in 2004, when Melissa and Joe Gorga got married, things were definitely less dramatic.

This is likely because when Melissa got married in 2004, she wasn't famous yet. She became more well-known when she became a cast member on The Real Housewives of New Jersey in 2011.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/was-real-housewives-of-orange-county-star-tamra-judge-ever-friends-with-teresa-giudice-before-their-brutal-fight_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Was Tamra Judge Ever Friends With Teresa Giudice Before Their Brutal Fight On Real Housewives Of Orange County?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>It was shocking when Tamra Judge and Teresa Giudice had a huge argument, and fans are curious about whether the Real Housewives stars have a history.</span><p>Melissa hasn't said much about her wedding day, which is likely because it happened pre-fame. She has definitely shared a lot about her marriage, though. She and Joe have admitted to RHONJ viewers that they have experienced some rough patches.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/RHONJ-Melissa-Blames-Teresas-Reaction-For-Making-Luis-Ruelas-Video-Drama-Worse.jpg><p>In February 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Melissa talked about Joe</a> in an interview with Entertainment Tonight. She said, "We are one of the longest-standing couples on reality TV in general. [So] there's a lot of noise out there and we've learned to tune it out and not listen to it."</p><p>Melissa continued to Entertainment Tonight, "At the end of the day, Joe and I spend so much time together, we really do. We keep our feet on the ground, we understand the chaos that comes with being on this show but we just keep it very normal in this house. Even with our kids and like with school stuff, we just don't allow the noise to come in."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-money-did-teresa-giudice-spend-on-her-wedding-to-luis-ruelas>How Much Money Did Teresa Giudice Spend On Her Wedding To Luis Ruelas?</h2><p>Teresa Giudice and Luis Ruelas got married on August 6th, 2022.

It was painful for Melissa Gorga to realize that she hadn't been asked. There was also some drama since Melissa was hurt that Teresa hadn't invited her mother and sisters to the ceremony and reception. Fans finally got a look at the beautiful and luxurious wedding in episode 16 of season 13, "Teresa Gets Married."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/teresa-giudice-and-jacqueline-laurita.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Why RHONJ's Teresa Giudice And Jacqueline Laurita Were Feuding For Years</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Real Housewives of New Jersey's Teresa Giudice and Jacqueline Laurita reunited after years of feuding, but why did their fight start at all?</span><p>Even though figures aren't available for Melissa and Joe Gorga's wedding day, it seems fair to guess that Teresa Giudice spent more money on her wedding.</p><p>While many want to look great on their wedding day and think carefully about the hairstyle and makeup that they want, they probably can't afford to spend thousands of dollars on their look. Teresa can, however, and she definitely spent quite a lot of money. According to Us Weekly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teresa spent almost $10,000 on her hair for her wedding</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Teresa-Melissa-RHONJ.jpg><p>Lucia Casazza, a hairstylist who works with Teresa, was interviewed in August 2022 on Andy Cohen Live on SiriusXM. She explained that Teresa used "over $7,000 worth of extensions … and that kind of styling cost $2,500." Teresa also needed a lot of bobby pins (1,500 to be exact).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Casazza also said, “As we know, Teresa is the queen of Jersey.

Since Teresa got married after years of being a famous reality star, that added some extra costs.</p><p>According to Page Six, Teresa was upset when The Real Housewives of New York City star Ramona Singer shared the wedding invitation on her Instagram account. Teresa didn't want that getting out and was worried about strangers knowing the time, date, and location.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/luis-ruelas-teresa-giudice.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Teresa was interviewed on a Live! Casino & Hotel panel in August 2022 and said that she spent extra cash on security guards. She also had to send out more invitations. Teresa explained, "The second invitation I sent out was a rose box. Instead of them bringing them home, I sent them to their house. But it cost me extra money for postage and extra money for security. So thank you, Ramona.”</p><p>Teresa also seems to have paid a lot for her wedding dress. According to People, Mark Zurino, who created the dress, shared on Instagram that it was "a custom Mark Zunino Atelier blush mermaid gown that featured over 300 yards of hand-draped English netting. The train was over 100 inches long accented in crystal and pearl details with long white beaded evening gloves to match." While the exact cost is unknown, that must have been pricey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it's sad that Teresa Giudice's sister-in-law Melissa Gorga and brother Joe Gorga weren't there on her wedding day, Teresa seems to have had an incredible time. As RHONJ fans know, it remains to be seen whether Teresa and Melissa can ever get to a better place.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdqbKzsdKaZKChpZm2pLHSZq6enJSeu6h5wqiqrWWdpL%2BmedOhmKdlo57AtbHRZqCnZZyWxG65xKWgrKuRYrSwvsaaqmablaeyrrvNsmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./heres-the-best-way-to-watch-steinsgate.html><span>←</span><span>Best Steins;Gate Watch Order</span></a>
