So, she didn’t want to disclose all her past adventures and who she is dating even now. However, she did mention that she’s stepping into the adult business industry through an IG post on June 13, 2022. Meaning — either her boyfriend is ok with it or she didn’t have one at all.</span></p><p><span>Her “announcement” IG post featured herself peering seductively out of a hot tub while wearing a black triangle bikini top. It was captioned, “Click the link in my bio if u wanna see more 💋.” And over the bio was the link to her Only fans account.</span></p><p><span>Seeing Sami step into this bold business, Charlie expressed his discontent, “I do not condone this, but since I’m unable to prevent it, I urged her to keep it classy, creative.”</span></p><p><span>Also, the </span><i><span>Two and a Half Men</span></i><span> actor blamed his ex-wife/Sami’s mother, Denise Richards, for their daughter’s decision.
