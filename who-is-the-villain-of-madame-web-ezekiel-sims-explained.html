So who is Ezekiel Sims in Madame Web?</p><h2 id=h-who-is-ezekiel-sims-in-madame-web data-injectable=false>Who is Ezekiel Sims in Madame Web?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Madame-Web-Ezekiel-Sims-1.png><p data-characters=485 data-current-count=785 data-injectable=true>French-Algerian actor Tahar Rahim (The Serpent) plays Ezekiel Sims, and his intriguing debut in the Madame Web trailer only served to skyrocket fans’ interest in seeing him on screen. The mysterious Sims is depicted as a figure in an all-black very Spider-Man-alike suit who is pursuing the Spider-Women with ruthless determination. It’s only thanks to Cassandra’s clairvoyancy that she’s able to stay one step ahead of the supervillain as he tracks them down.</p><p data-characters=608 data-current-count=608 data-injectable=true>Going by what we can pull together from the trailer, Sims is an old colleague of Cassandra’s parents from an expedition to the Amazon rainforest. Given that this is a Spider-Man spinoff, logic dictates some kind of rare spider was discovered there. A grey-haired, older Sims is glimpsed, in contrast to the younger version (depicted above), and we get glimpses of Julia, Anya, and Maddie in superhero costumes, as well as talk of their futures being under threat. It seems, then, that Sims has traveled back to the present to take out the Spider-Women before they can grow powerful enough to stop him.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Is Ezekiel Sims a Spider-Person in Marvel lore?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Spider-Man-Ezekiel-Sims-1.jpg><p data-characters=435 data-current-count=735 data-injectable=true>Those who are actually familiar with the character of Ezekiel Sims on the page may be surprised by his depiction in the movie as Sims is not in fact a villain in Marvel Comics. He’s actually more of a mentor, almost another Uncle Ben-like figure, for Peter Parker. He’s most notable for revealing the truth about Spider-Totems, a concept which turned Spidey lore upside down but has yet to be referenced on the big screen.</p><p data-characters=478 data-current-count=478 data-injectable=true>Basically, the Spider-Totems are mystical multiversal gods who choose champions to be their avatars on Earth — think the Egyptian Ennead in Moon Knight — and protect the Web of Life and Destiny. In the comics, Madame Web’s psychic powers derive from her connection to the Web, so it’s vaguely possible the Spider-Totems — a concept which changes the Spider-Man narrative from a scientific accident to a magical Chosen One story — could factor into the film.</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=364 data-injectable=false>As for Sims himself, he is indeed a Spider-Person himself, although he developed powers very similar to Spider-Man through a mystical ritual rather than a spider-bite. Movie viewers, you’ve actually already encountered him before, as Sims was depicted as the comedic Spider-Therapist character (voiced by Mike Rianda) in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</a>.</p><p data-characters=64 data-current-count=428 data-injectable=false>Madame Web is officially scheduled to release on Feb. 14, 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGnXZ7AbsDHnmSvoZyhrqq6jKidZqWRma6usYywnJtlla%2ByrLXEpWSsoZ2oeqbEz6WYoqaVmXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-beyonces-net-worth-in-2024.html><span>←</span><span>What is Beyonce's Net Worth in 2024?</span></a>
