This time, a diamond-encrusted grill with opal stones.</p><p class=p1>The reality star took to Instagram on March, 17 to show off her new bling and we’re pretty much speechless. Talk about sparkle!</p><p class=p1>The grill itself is designed to cover the bottom 8 teeth and features shimmering opal stones with flecks of pink, green, yellow, blue and purple over each tooth. The gemstones are outlined in pavé diamonds as well.</p><p class=p1>Kardashian captioned the the photo, “New opal birthstone grill alert,” and also tagged <a href=#>Gabby Elan Jewelry</a>, the designer responsible for her new mouthpiece.</p><p class=p1>Gabby Elan Jewelry, which is based in Calabasas, has quite the roster of celebrity clients including <strong>Pharrell</strong>, <strong>A$AP Rocky</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Heidi Klum</strong></a>. More recently, the company created <a href=#><strong>Dua Lipa</strong></a>’s butterfly grill, which she wore to the 2021 Grammys on Sunday, March 14.</p><p class=p1>Us Weekly spoke with <strong>Elan Pinhasov</strong>, co-owner of Gabby Elan Jewelry and, while the official price was not released, and learned that the opal and diamond mouthpiece is estimated around $18,000.</p><p class=p1>Pinhasov notes that the diamond pavé frame totals around $6,000, due to the quality of the stone, while the opals themselves cost nearly double that, ringing in at “around” $12,000.</p><p class=p1>Kardashian has had this bling on her radar for quite some time too, because according to Pinhasov, the piece took nearly 2 months to create.</p><p class=p1>“We have really skilled diamond-setters and stone-setters with a lot of experience, which is why it came out so perfect,” the jewelry guru tells Stylish over the phone.</p><p>Kathyrn Money from <a href=#>Brilliant Earth</a> also notes that opal stones are a “unique” choice for a grill. “Opals are popularly known for their milky, rainbow glow and fire … it’s the perfect complement to the sparkle of the surrounding diamonds.”</p><p>But that’s not all that interesting about the stone. <strong>Dr. Matt Nejad</strong> notes: “From an aesthetic point opal is really cool. Natural teeth have a feature called opalescence and we use the stone opal to get that effect when we do veneers. We’re trying to mimic that opal effect where teeth look a little different in different lighting.”</p><p class=p1>People obviously had a lot to say about the soon-to-be lawyer’s new bling and quickly took to commenting on her post. Influencer <strong>Natalie Halcro</strong> noted she was “obsessed” with the flashy mouth piece, while Real Housewives of New Jersey star <strong>Dolores Catania</strong> supported the pricy purchase, writing, “I think I want this.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Other fans were a bit more critical of Kardashian’s new sparkly smile, noting that the last time she posted a picture of a glitzy grill to Instagram was prior to her Paris robbery. One user very frankly points out, “Remember you posted a pic of your grill and then got robbed.”</p><p class=p1>This is in reference to a post the KKW Beauty founder shared back in 2016, showing off a diamond grill via Instagram. A few days later, $10 million of her jewelry was stolen in <a href=#>a violet robbery</a> in her Paris hotel room.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6C2rnnKmqmdmaOdtqK60mabopmdpLulecCnm2anoJa5brPRoqOlZZWowaq5wK2cnWWTpMC1ecOeq5qhnKh8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ipek-filiz-yazc.html><span>←</span><span>Is Netflix's Love 101 Actress, Ipek Filiz Yazici Dating?
