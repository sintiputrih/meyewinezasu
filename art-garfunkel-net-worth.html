He is best known for his role in the folk-rock duo Simon & Garfunkel, where he released chart-topping hits such as “The Sound of Silence” and “Mrs. Robinson” alongside Paul Simon. However, the two artists had a tumultuous relationship, and ultimately went their separate ways.</p><p>Despite Paul Simon being the primary songwriter for Simon & Garfunkel, Art Garfunkel established himself as a solo artist. He released a top ten hit and several other charting tracks. Throughout his career, Garfunkel has received a People’s Choice Award and eight Grammys. He and Paul Simon were also inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. Today, Garfunkel is considered one of the greatest singers of all time.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Musical_Beginnings>Early Life and Musical Beginnings</span></h2><p>Arthur Ira Garfunkel was born on November 5th of 1941 in Forest Hills, Queens, New York City. Raised in a Romanian Jewish household, Art’s earliest musical experiences involved singing in his local synagogue. By first grade, he was singing songs like “Unchained Melody” and “You’ll Never Walk Alone.” At a young age, he used a wire recorder to record his singing and improve upon his flaws. During his bar mitzvah, he sang for four hours straight as part of the ceremony.</p><p>A lung infection as a teen forced Art to stop singing for an entire summer, so he spent his time practicing basketball. He first ran into Paul Simon during the sixth grade, and the pair performed together in a school production of “Alice in Wonderland.” From the mid-50s to the early 60s, Simon and Garfunkel performed together as “Tom & Jerry” and released “Hey Schoolgirl,” which reached number 49 on the charts.</p><p>It was during this time that Simon and Garfunkel had their first major disagreement. Simon neglected to inform Garfunkel of a contract for two more singles as a solo artist, and Art felt betrayed. After Tom & Jerry, the pair went their separate ways.</p><h2><span id=College_Years_and_Education>College Years and Education</span></h2><p>After graduating from high school, Garfunkel attended Columbia University and majored in architecture. During his college years, he joined various sports teams and an all-male a cappella group called the Columbia Kingsmen. In 1965, Art earned a B.A. in art history and eventually graduated with an M.A. in mathematics education in 1967.</p><h2><span id=Simon_Garfunkel_From_Failure_to_Success>Simon & Garfunkel: From Failure to Success</span></h2><p>In 1963, Art and Garfunkel decided to reform their duo, choosing the name Simon & Garfunkel. Their debut album, “Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M,” failed to impress critics, and the pair split once again. However, the re-release of “The Sound of Silence” as a single in 1965 proved to be a huge success, topping the charts. Over the next period, Simon & Garfunkel collaborated on four successful albums, including the most successful “Bridge Over Troubled Water,” which sold over 25 million units and received two Grammy Awards. Their contribution to the soundtrack of “The Graduate” resulted in one of their most popular tracks, “Mrs. Robinson.”</p><h2><span id=Art_Garfunkels_Solo_Career_and_Personal_Struggles>Art Garfunkel’s Solo Career and Personal Struggles</span></h2><p>Art Garfunkel’s solo career began in 1970 after he split from Paul Simon due to personal differences. Despite occasional reconnections for concerts, Garfunkel pursued his own solo career, releasing albums like “Angel Clare” and “Breakaway.” However, his career suffered from a number of setbacks, including the suicide of his longtime girlfriend Laurie Bird, which left him uninspired to create music. Garfunkel fell into a depression and withdrew from public life after the disappointing album “Scissors Cut” and the death of his father.</p><p>Garfunkel eventually returned to music, writing his own songs for the first time and collaborating with Paul Simon once again in 2009. However, their relationship soured when Garfunkel had to withdraw from a tour due to vocal cord paresis, and Simon blamed him for not being honest and letting everyone down.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunCt0a1koJmim8Kvt8SlZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anna-lore-actress-wikipedia-biography-age-height-weight-boyfriend-net-worth-career-facts.html><span>←</span><span>Anna Lore (Actress) Wikipedia, Biography, Age, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Career, Facts</span></a>
