And then they get this attitude, ‘cause they’re so used to getting whatever they want. And so, here I walk in, and I just tear them down to pieces about everything that I think of ‘em and why I absolutely wouldn’t go there.”</p><p>The choreographer noted that she gives her partners a choice to compete or “run away with your tail between your legs because you didn’t get what you wanted.”</p><p>Burgess almost looked for love elsewhere in the reality TV world: Australia’s version of <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a>. “I was initially like, ‘Sure.’ I mean, that could be fun. And then as I got into it, there was something that didn’t feel right … which is odd because I love the show worldwide,’” she exclusively told Us Weekly in August 2020. “For some reason, my instincts were saying, ‘Don’t do it,’ which was very bizarre. I’ve had to trust my instincts my whole life, they’ve led me to where I am now.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Australia native turned down the offer, but she acknowledged at the time that it <a href=#>“makes more sense” for her to be the Bachelorette in the U.S.</a> since she lives in the country and has no plans to move Down Under.</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to see who Burgess has been linked to through the years, including Green, <a href=#><strong>Jason Oppenheim</strong></a> and more famous men!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwKmt0aeYZpqlp7Smv9Jmm5qsmaO0brTIrKuoqqlisrex0bJkppmeYsCpsdJmmZ6dnmK5qrrKnptmrJ9k</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lil-uzi-vert-takes-over-soho-while-shooting-just-wanna-rock-music-video.html><span>←</span><span>Lil Uzi Vert Takes Over SoHo While Shooting 'Just Wanna Rock' Music Video</span></a>
