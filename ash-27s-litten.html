In <i><a href=# title=SM004>First Catch in Alola, Ketchum-Style!</a></i>, Litten was seen being fed by <a href=# title=Anela>Anela</a> in a marketplace on the beach. It saw a wild <a href=# title="Ash's Rowlet">Rowlet</a> carrying off a wind chime.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM007>That's Why the Litten is a Scamp!</a></i>, Litten approached Ash and Pikachu to get something to eat. When Ash offered it a piece of the sandwich, it stole the larger portion and ran off, only to be stopped and foiled by an <a href=# title="Alolan form">Alolan</a> <a href=# title="Persian (Pokémon)">Persian</a>. Annoyed by Litten's trickery, Ash promised to <a href=# title="Caught Pokémon">catch</a> it. The next day, Ash and Pikachu saw Litten being attacked by the previous Alolan Persian and stopped it. Litten, despite being on the verge of collapse, protested against being brought to the <a href=# title="Pokémon Center">Pokémon Center</a>, biting and scratching Ash all the way there. After being treated, Ash brought it to <a href=# title="Professor Kukui (anime)">Professor Kukui</a>'s house, but it managed to escape in the middle of the night. Ash, Pikachu, and <a href=# title="Rotom Pokédex (anime)">Rotom</a> followed Litten to an abandoned house, where they discovered that Litten had been gathering food for an old Stoutland. Having learned this, Ash gave up on capturing Litten, leaving it to care for its caretaker. Suddenly, the group was attacked by the Alolan Persian from earlier. Ash had everyone leave the house, where Pikachu and Litten started battling the Persian. Litten eventually defeated Persian and successfully protected Stoutland. The next day, Ash discovered that Litten and Stoutland had relocated. After being assured by Anela that Litten was doing fine, Litten appeared from behind her to grab the fruit she had prepared and ran off into the distance.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM016>They Might Not Be Giants!</a></i>, Litten was seen when Ash's Rowlet and <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Lana's Popplio">Lana's Popplio</a> got separated from their <a href=# title="Pokémon Trainer">Trainers</a> and fought <a href=# title="Meowth (Team Rocket)">Meowth</a> off when he tried to catch them.

Ash witnessed how Stoutland helped it learn <a href=# title="Fire Fang (move)">Fire Fang</a>, but Litten was unsuccessful in mastering the move. Later, Litten ran up to Ash, desperate for help with a collapsed Stoutland. After escaping Team Rocket, Ash was brought to its home and carried Stoutland to the Pokémon Center. Litten ran into the emergency room to be with its friend while <a href=# title="Nurse Joy">Nurse Joy</a> informed Ash of Stoutland's condition. When Ash returned to the center the next day to check on Litten and Stoutland, he was shocked to see they had left. Litten practiced its Fire Fang at its home again but failed once more. Displeased with having the same results as its previous attempt, Litten curled up into Stoutland and fell asleep, having a dream where it chased after Stoutland and could not catch up. Litten soon woke up alone and immediately panicked again, searching various parts of Melemele Island for Stoutland.</p><p>Upon returning home, one of the supports of the sofa the two Pokémon had been sleeping on broke as a tree shed its last leaf, and a massive storm whipped up over Melemele. Wracked with grief upon realizing it would never see Stoutland again, Litten looked up to the sky and started yowling. Ash and his Pokémon found Litten asleep on the sofa, curled up next to the tree's leaf, and kept visiting it to comfort the Fire Cat Pokémon. While the others were still sleeping beside the sofa, Litten woke up as the rain stopped and saw a cloud formation shaped like Stoutland behind a rainbow, seemingly smiling in approval. Gathered with resolve, Litten offered Ash a <a href=# title="Sitrus Berry">Sitrus Berry</a>. Afterwards, Litten agreed to battle Ash and Pikachu and successfully executed Fire Fang. After the battle, Litten allowed Ash to catch it, the Trainer having finally gained its trust. When sent out again, Litten happily joined in with the rest of Ash's Pokémon when he poured out the rest of the Berries in his shopping bag.</p><h5><span class=mw-headline id=With_Ash>With Ash</span></h5><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM022>A Shivering Shovel Search!</a></i>, Litten was seen <a href=# title="Pokémon training">training</a> with <a href=# title="Kiawe's Turtonator">Kiawe's Turtonator</a> to master Fire Fang, but was still unsuccessful in mastering the move. Later, when Ash was stuck inside an enraged <a href=# title="Palossand (Pokémon)">Palossand</a>'s body, Litten got caught in its body as well when protecting <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Ash's Rockruff">Rockruff</a>. Palossand began absorbing Litten's life force, causing it to be unable to leave Palossand's body.

At first, her sudden approach made Litten freak out, but once she started petting it, Litten got more comfortable.

As Litten struggled with Lurantis's now immediate <a href=# title="Solar Blade (move)">Solar Blades</a> and Castform's <a href=# title="Water Gun (move)">Water Guns</a>, Ash sent out Rowlet to assist it. With the help of Rowlet, Litten was able to fight on equal ground against its opponents. After a hard-fought battle, Rowlet managed to defeat Castform, allowing Litten to use <a href=# title="Breakneck Blitz (move)">Breakneck Blitz</a> to knock Lurantis out as well.

When Ash and <a href=# title="Ash's friends">his classmates</a> later went to visit the <a href=# title="Battle Royal Dome">Battle Royal Dome</a> during a special event where anyone could volunteer to face the Masked Royal in a Battle Royal, Litten jumped down from the stands to the arena, prompting Ash to take part in the Battle Royal, joined by <a href=# title="Kiawe (anime)">Kiawe</a> and <a href=# title="Sophocles (anime)">Sophocles</a>. Although <a href=# title="Kiawe's Marowak">Kiawe's Marowak</a> and <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Sophocles's Charjabug">Sophocles's Charjabug</a> were soon defeated by Incineroar's <a href=# title="Darkest Lariat (move)">Darkest Lariat</a>, Litten managed to survive the attack.

This defeat later inspired Ash to teach Litten <a href=# title="Flame Charge (move)">Flame Charge</a>. Some days later, during Litten's training, the Masked Royal challenged Ash to a one-on-one battle. Still not having completely mastered Flame Charge, Litten struggled throughout the battle. However, thanks to Ash's determination, Litten was able to evolve into a <a href=# title="Torracat (Pokémon)">Torracat</a>, perfecting Flame Charge in the process. Although the evolution and the <a href=# title=Stat>Speed</a> increase from Flame Charge gave Torracat more edge in the battle, to the point where it even managed to damage Incineroar a bit, it was still eventually defeated by its evolved form.

Later, after Torracat mastered its new move, the mist lifted, and Stoutland's spirit returned to the afterlife.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM125>A Timeless Encounter!</a></i>, Torracat and Ash were <a href=# title="Time travel">sent to the past</a> after accidentally startling a <a href=# title="Celebi (Pokémon)">Celebi</a> while training. There, they encountered and befriended a younger version of Kukui and his Incineroar, who was a Litten at the time. By borrowing Kukui's <a href=# title="Firium Z">Firium Z</a>, Ash and Torracat performed <a href=# title="Inferno Overdrive (move)">Inferno Overdrive</a> for the first time.

Torracat used Flame Charge to boost its <a href=# title=Stat>Speed</a> and try to overwhelm Kukui's Incineroar with it, but its opponent's experience in Battle Royals allowed it to see through this tactic. Incineroar countered with a powerful <a href=# title="Blast Burn (move)">Blast Burn</a>, only for Torracat to absorb the attack into the flame sac on its neck.

Ash recalled Torracat again, saving it for the final confrontation with Incineroar.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM143>Fiery Surprises!</a></i>, Torracat was sent out against Kukui's Incineroar. As Torracat recovered from an unintentional overload of energy it had sustained earlier, it had a hard-fought battle against Incineroar, with both Pokémon landing and receiving hard blows. As Torracat's energy was pushed to the limit, both Ash and Kukui commanded Inferno Overdrive to be used against each other's Pokémon, and the two overpowered fireballs melded, causing a storm of fire energy. The two Pokémon leaped into the blaze to trade blows, with Torracat landing a super-effective Revenge. As the two emerged from the firestorm, they stared each other down until Incineroar collapsed. Just after it was declared the winner, Torracat suddenly evolved into Incineroar. However, the expended energy from the evolution caused it to pass out while still standing and thus be unable to continue battling.</p><p>Following Ash's decision to travel the <a href=# title="Pokémon world">world</a>, he left Incineroar, along with his other Alolan Pokémon, with Professors Kukui and <a href=# title="Professor Burnet (anime)">Burnet</a>, before heading back to <a href=# title="Pallet Town">Pallet Town</a>.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/0/0a/Ash_and_Incineroar.png/375px-Ash_and_Incineroar.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Incineroar and Ash<h4><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_Journeys:_The_Series></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_Journeys:_The_Series><i><a href=# title="Pokémon Journeys: The Series">Pokémon Journeys: The Series</a></i></span></h4><p>In <i><a href=# title=JN037>That New Old Gang of Mine!</a></i>, Incineroar greeted Ash upon his return to Alola and also met <a href=# title=Goh>Goh</a>.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=JN112>Helping the Hometown Hero!</a></i>, Incineroar attended a party to celebrate the return of Lillie and her family after they found <a href=# title=Mohn>Mohn</a>.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=JN131>Paring Pokémon While Parrying!</a></i>, Incineroar watched Ash's match against <a href=# title="Leon (anime)">Leon</a>.

For this reason, it was suggested by Stoutland that Litten guided <a href=# title="Ash's Rowlet">Rowlet</a> and <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Lana's Popplio">Popplio</a> back to Ash in <i><a href=# title=SM016>They Might Not Be Giants!</a></i>.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/7/74/Litten_fiery_disposition.png/375px-Litten_fiery_disposition.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Litten showing off its fiery disposition<p>Its first encounter with Ash did not go over so well: he accidentally stepped on Litten's tail while running along the beach, and it responded by burning his face with <a href=# title="Ember (move)">Ember</a>. Encounters with Litten after that were unpleasant for Ash as well, as Litten tended to attack him or steal his food, showing off cunning and slick characteristics to its enigmatic personality, such as in <i><a href=# title=SM007>That's Why the Litten is a Scamp!</a></i>. When Stoutland thought it would be a good idea for Litten to join Ash, Litten wasn't keen on the idea, but its mentality started to change when Stoutland collapsed due to ill health, and it was desperate for him to help it. After grieving and ultimately accepting Stoutland's absence, Litten began trying to offer its food to Ash, much like it had done with Stoutland. Despite their growing relationship and mutual trust, Litten still shows a tendency to burn Ash in the face even after befriending him, though now, it seems to be done mainly as a sign of affection toward him, much like <a href=# title="Ash's Charizard">Charizard</a> before it.</p><p>After being taken in by Ash, it has reflected its solicitous nature over Stoutland on its new teammates. This was showcased in <i><a href=# title=SM022>A Shivering Shovel Search!</a></i>, when it protected <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Ash's Rockruff">Rockruff</a> from being eaten by an angry <a href=# title="Palossand (Pokémon)">Palossand</a> and was even fine with Rockruff sleeping next to itself, despite putting the fact that it did not want to play with it earlier. This shows Litten is willing to open up to its new family despite its innately frisky nature. Litten is cold and apathetic towards strangers; however, in <i><a href=# title=SM024>Alolan Open House!</a></i>, when it was introduced to its Trainer's <a href=# title="Delia Ketchum">mother</a>, it couldn't resist being stroked gently under its chin.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/3/3d/Ash_Lycanroc_Litten_sparing.png/375px-Ash_Lycanroc_Litten_sparing.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Litten sparring with Lycanroc<p>Since its capture, Litten has grown close to its Trainer and helps fellow Pokémon. For example, in <i><a href=# title=SM030>The Ol' Raise and Switch!</a></i>, it helped <a href=# title=Snowy>Snowy</a> warm up towards Ash and even offered Snowy a <a href=# title="Sitrus Berry">Sitrus Berry</a>. Despite growing to care for others more, it still tends to become somewhat aggressive, as shown in <i><a href=# title=SM028>Pulling Out the Pokémon Base Pepper!</a></i>, when it got angry towards a nearby baseball, and in <i><a href=# title=SM045>Now You See Them, Now You Don't!</a></i>, when it got annoyed at Ash's Lycanroc. As seen in <i><a href=# title=SM048>Night of a Thousand Poses!</a></i> and <i><a href=# title=SM049>Mission: Total Recall!</a></i>, Litten tends to spar with Lycanroc on occasion, even when it is separated from its Trainer. This friendly rivalry with Lycanroc was again shown in <i><a href=# title=SM096>Don't Ignore the Small Stufful!</a></i> when it fought with it over who could eat their food the quickest. Despite this, Incineroar does get along with Lycanroc, as they often hang out when they are not sparring or bickering.</p><p>Since learning about the <a href=# title="Professor Kukui's Incineroar">Masked Royal's Incineroar</a>, Litten was keen on battling it. However, their first battle ended quickly, as, despite essentially being a three-on-one, Incineroar proved to be much stronger than its opponents combined. Some days later, they had a rematch, during which Litten evolved into Torracat. This battle marked the start of their rivalry, which eventually culminated at the <a href=# title="Manalo Conference">Manalo Conference</a>'s exhibition match against <a href=# title="Professor Kukui (anime)">Professor Kukui</a>, when Torracat finally managed to defeat its rival and, somewhat poetically, ended up evolving. Despite its rivalry with Professor Kukui's Incineroar, Ash's Incineroar still cares for it, as it moved to help out Incineroar from the <a href=# title=Revengers>Revengers</a>' Pokémon after they unfairly ganged up on it. This was shown in <i><a href=# title=SM092>Turning the Other Mask!</a></i> when it became distressed when it couldn't see Incineroar after the Masked Royal called it back into its <a href=# title="Poké Ball (item)">Poké Ball</a>. Litten also has a strong sense of smell, as seen in <i><a href=# title=SM063>Pushing the Fiery Envelope!</a></i>, when it immediately recognized the Masked Royal as Professor Kukui after sniffing his scent.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Appearance>Appearance</span></h3><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Moves_used>Moves used</span></h3><table class=roundy><tbody readability=3.1941747572816><tr readability=2.048309178744><td><table><tbody readability=2><tr readability=2><td class=roundy><table class=roundy><tbody readability=1><tr><td><a href=# class=image><img alt="Ash Litten Fire Fang.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/d/d6/Ash_Litten_Fire_Fang.png/300px-Ash_Litten_Fire_Fang.png decoding=async width=200 height=113 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td align=center>Using Fire Fang as a Litten</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=roundy><table class=roundy><tbody readability=1><tr><td><a href=# class=image><img alt="Ash Torracat Scratch.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/0/06/Ash_Torracat_Scratch.png/300px-Ash_Torracat_Scratch.png decoding=async width=200 height=113 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Using Scratch as a Torracat</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td class=roundy></td></tr><tr readability=1.3411764705882><td colspan=2 class=roundy>An <b><span>×</span></b> shows that the move <a href=# title="Anime move errors"><span>cannot be legitimately known</span></a> by this Pokémon in the games.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td colspan=2 class=roundy>A <b><span>†</span></b> shows that the move was used recently, unless all moves fit this case or there are fewer than five known moves.</td></tr></tbody></table><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Z-Moves_used><a href=# title=Z-Move>Z-Moves</a> used</span></h4><table class=roundy><tbody readability=3.0649606299213><tr readability=2.0220588235294><td><table><tbody readability=1><tr readability=2><td class=roundy><table class=roundy><tbody readability=1><tr><td><a href=# class=image><img alt="Ash Litten Breakneck Blitz.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/8/86/Ash_Litten_Breakneck_Blitz.png/300px-Ash_Litten_Breakneck_Blitz.png decoding=async width=200 height=113 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td align=center>Using Breakneck Blitz<br>as a Litten</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td class=roundy></td></tr><tr readability=4><td colspan=2 class=roundy>A <b><span>†</span></b> shows that the move was used recently, unless all moves fit this case or there are fewer than five known moves.</td></tr></tbody></table><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Moves_improvised>Moves improvised</span></h4><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Artwork>Artwork</span></h3><h2><span class=mw-headline id=In_the_games>In the games</span></h2><h3><span class=mw-headline id=In_the_spin-off_games>In the spin-off games</span></h3><h4><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_Ga-Ol.C3.A9></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_Ga-Olé><a href=# title="Pokémon Ga-Olé">Pokémon Ga-Olé</a></span></h4><p>Torracat appears in <a href=# title="Pokémon Ga-Olé">Pokémon Ga-Olé</a>.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=In_the_TCG>In the TCG</span></h2><p>Ash's Incineroar has a dedicated card for it in the <a href=# title="Pokémon Trading Card Game">Pokémon Trading Card Game</a>.
