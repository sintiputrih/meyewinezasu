My mom, she’s super amazing. Definitely someone you can look up to.”</span></p><p><span>John Joseph goes on to say that his mom’s colon cancer was diagnosed in the early stages, and he believes that chemotherapy could have helped. But his mom did not get the treatment and instead followed husband <b><a href=#>John Daniel Kingston</a></b>‘s instructions, as the church discourages using doctors who are not part of the faith. (Patricia was one of Kingston’s 14 wives, and the clip does not reveal whether she is still alive.)</span></p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt width=1000 height=601 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“My dad had a thing … that was supposed to shoot radio waves or something like that, that she would sit between for about two hours a day, and it was supposed to somehow get rid of the cancer,” John Joseph tells the camera. “My dad had my mom do a lot of enemas for her treatment. And then he also had a diet that he would have her go on. During this time, she got really, really skinny because she was on such a low-calorie diet, and they told her to do some fasting.”</p><p><span>“My mom actually had some painkillers that she took,” he continues. “My dad found them, and it wasn’t part of the diet, so he took it out, and I was thinking, ‘How could you just take it? If she wants that, then she should get that.'”</span></p><p>Watch the emotional clip in the video above.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><i>Escaping Polygamy</i> airs on A&E Sundays at 10 p.m. ET.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJysm5Gltq%2BzjKmmpbGXlrq6edKtmKtlna56pa3DZp%2BinF2ixm65zqaqZpuRo7CmvoymnJ2hk567pnnWbWpvbGhtfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jesse-garcia-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-222465-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jesse Garcia Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
