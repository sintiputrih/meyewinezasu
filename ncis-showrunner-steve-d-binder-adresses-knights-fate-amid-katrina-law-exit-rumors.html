"Well, you know, we've set something up there, and I will point you toward our track record where 'You never know,'" he said.&nbsp;</p><p id=e-UqltHsnJm data-wc=26>"We've had people look like they were going away and then it's found out they weren't going away, and then people who just disappear like Gibbs."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/69a1bb24c3e8-katrina-law-on-ncis.jpg><p id=eTWtpiA14l_ data-wc=49>"I will say this. We do aim to please, and we think the audience will be satisfied with where they see this go," Steve continued. "Sometimes that satisfaction is bittersweet and sometimes it's just pure joy. You'll have to wait to find out which one it's going to be."&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>Have you caught up with season 21 of NCIS?</figure><p id=exZjGcfddOu data-wc=54>As fans of the show will remember, in the season finale Jessica was offered a new job as Chief REACT Training Officer by Director Leon Vance, which she gladly accepted. Unfortunately for the character, her decision didn't go down well with her boyfriend, Dr Jimmy Palmer, who was reluctant to enter a long-distance relationship.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Read more</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="NCIS: Hawai'i star Alex Tarrant's next role after show cancellation - details" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/16ee7877dbd5-alex-tarrant-ncis.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="NCIS: Hawai'i star Alex Tarrant's next role after show cancellation - details" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>NCIS: Hawai'i star Alex Tarrant's next role after show cancellation - details</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="NCIS stars Michael Weatherly and Cote de Pablo to reunite with former co-stars for major new project — details" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/689bf309ff7b-michael-weatherly-cote-de-pablo.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="NCIS stars Michael Weatherly and Cote de Pablo to reunite with former co-stars for major new project — details" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>NCIS stars Michael Weatherly and Cote de Pablo to reunite with former co-stars for major new project — details</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Pauley Perrette left 'in shock' as she mourns loss of Sam Rubin and relives NCIS days" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/9f2e5f2282aa-pauley-perrette-latest.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Pauley Perrette left 'in shock' as she mourns loss of Sam Rubin and relives NCIS days" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Pauley Perrette left 'in shock' as she mourns loss of Sam Rubin and relives NCIS days</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=ehZgZ81icC_ data-wc=38>Ready to move to another coast, Jessica's conversation with Jimmy seemed pretty conclusive, fuelling further speculation that Katrina Law will hang up her badge. But, of course, this is we're talking about, and nothing is ever simple.&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eM1GaoofV2s data-wc=46>Last month, Katrina herself hinted that she will appear in series 22, with her character's future determined in the next instalment. "Guess we gotta wait for CBS FALL," she penned on Instagram. "Until then..catch up on @ncisverse on @paramountplus. Thank you all for a wonderful season."</p><p id=eWtZCMDhE60 data-wc=21>Addressing Jessica's decision to take the job at Camp Pendleton, Katrina has also mused that it was right for her character.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/eb17ed32913b-jimmy-palmer-jessica-knight-ncis.jpg><p id=eXktGkQ2hlQ data-wc=28>"I think that at the end, Jessica has to take this position because she knows deep down this is what she wants," the actress told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>TV Line</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=eyxFhKybPk8V data-wc=56>"She wants a career, she's very ambitious, and to her a long-distance relationship isn't the end of things. At the same time, maybe it is, if it doesn't work out. She has to go forward and see where these things lead, she can't settle into something she knows will ultimately make her angry and have regrets.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3d91feb05370-ncis-season-21-finale.jpg><p id=eeFEHMJkZQj2 data-wc=43>"And I think Jimmy's in the same place — he had a chance to basically say, 'Please don't take this job' and he didn't. He instinctively knows that Knight needs to go do this, and then they can see where they are after."&nbsp;</p><p id=eJKcfOiqve6p data-wc=44>So, when can fans tune into the 22nd season of NCIS? While an official release date is yet to be announced, the show has historically returned in September, so we're hoping that we'll find out what's next for Jessica Knight in just three months.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
