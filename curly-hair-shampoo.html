I've seen lots of love for celebrity hairstylist Jen Atkin on Instagram, and it's clear she's a big fan of Ouidad's curly hair shampoo. Curly hair shampoo is excellent for getting beautiful defined, frizz-free curls without any need for harsh stuff like styling products.</span></p><h3><span style=font-weight:400>Mindful Considerations of Purchase&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mentioned below are the top considerations that you need to keep in mind when <a href=#>purchasing a curly hair shampoo</a>.</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Scalp&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Your scalp can be either normal, dry, or oily. Your scalp type determines the <a href=#>shampoo</a> you choose, along with the ingredients. It is hard for the product to penetrate the scalp if you have curly hair. Go for ingredients with intense hydration if you have a dry scalp. However, for an oily scalp, go for volumizing ingredients rather than hydrating ones. People with curly hair and a normal scalp are considered lucky, as you don't need to do too much research to determine what shampoo suits you.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Length&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>The size of the bottle you choose depends on the length of your hair. Longer curly hair requires more product, so it's a good idea to stock up on your desired product rather than going to the store to buy it over and over again.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Ingredients&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>There is a common misconception that curly hair requires all the hydration in the world. Besides being far from the truth, it can also damage your hair in the longer run. Applying excessive moisturizer to oily hair can wear them down. On the other hand, you need balancing ingredients for dry hair.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Fragrance&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Most people opt for shampoos that deliver a punching and fruity fragrance in the longer run. On the other hand, some individuals focus on the results of shampoos rather than their scents. Ingredients like coconut, hibiscus, and cocoa leave your hair smelling better than ever.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style=font-weight:400>Benefits of Curly Hair Shampoo&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Let’s discuss the benefits of explicitly using curly hair shampoos on your scalp.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Cleansing&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>The first and foremost way that shampoos benefit your hair is cleansing. Curly hair may get dirty very quickly. They can retain a lot of dirt, grime, and pollution from the environment. Using the right shampoo for your scalp can help you cleanse your hair gently without damaging it. Most of these <a href=#>curly hair shampoos</a> are designed to penetrate deep into the scalp leaving your follicles nourished and balanced.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Maintaining structure&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Curly hair gets damaged very easily if you apply unwanted stress and pressure on them. It is essential to use the right shampoo that does not tangle your hair or damage the integrity of its structure.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Fragrance and fluff&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Shampoos come with a fragrant finish that may make you keep touching them repeatedly. Other than this, the shampoo leaves a soft and fluffy finish that allows you to regain the lost softness.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style=font-weight:400>Curly Hair Shampoo for Different Scalps&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>The curly hair shampoo you choose should also complement your scalp.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Normal scalp shampoo&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>The normal scalp has the right amount of oil from the sebaceous glands. If you have curly hair along with a normal scalp, consider yourself among the few lucky people. The normal scalp does not retain any dandruff or dryness. It also does not cause itching. Shampoo with normal scalp comes with balanced detergents and conditioning agents with sufficient moisturization so you can maintain the quality of your hair. Regular scalp shampoo can be applied on curly hair 1 to 3 times a week, ensuring maximum cleansing, ultimate bounce, and a luscious sheen.</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Oily scalp shampoo&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Although gifted with curly hair, some people might have an oily scalp that wears their hair down. Such hair requires regular cleansing and frequent washes as the scalp is prone to build-up and grime. When picking a shampoo for an oily scalp, look for labels like volumizing, balancing, and strengthening. Moisturizing and hydrating shampoos might wear your hair down as your scalp does not need a lot of lubricants. After testing different brands, you must finalize a shampoo to find a perfect fit. Pick a clarifying formula that is moderate and does not cause itching or irritation. Oily scalp demands a complete hair care routine depending on your hair length, so you get better results. Most people with wavy hair have an oily scalp which can even look prominent on the strands.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Dry scalp shampoo</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>A dry scalp causes extreme itching and can even be witnessed as colored flakes. Such people constantly have the urge to scratch their heads, resulting in more flaking and even nail or head-skin injuries. Women with intense curls (like <a href=#>4B</a> and 4C) have more chances of a dry scalp than others. Go for gentle formulas with anti-frizz properties and excessive moisturizing agents like shea butter and aloe vera to maintain the weight of your product. Some versions also contain volumizing labels, fortifying and strengthening ingredients to preserve their integrity.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style=font-weight:400>Type of Curly Hair Shampoos&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>The type of curly hair shampoo you use depends on the current situation of your scalp and head and the amount of product that is needed according to your hair.</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Normal curly hair shampoo&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Curly hair gets dry and tangled very easily. This is why it is essential to hydrate and moisturize them regularly. A normal shampoo for curly hair is designed to hydrate, cleanse and <a href=#>moisturize your hair</a> for a couple of days. Normal shampoos come with smoothening agents to seal the curls and retain moisture. In simpler words, they are a very mild detergent that cleanses your scalp without any excessive pressure. Your hair will maintain fluffy curls once they have dried.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Dry curly hair shampoo&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Longer curls or those treated with chemicals tend to dry out quickly. If you color or straighten your hair, it may become very sensitive and instantly react to pollution, photodamage, and heat. Dry shampoos are loaded with hydrants, soy extracts, and amino acids, preserving hair’s natural structure.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Balancing curly hair shampoos&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Balancing shampoos are designed to maintain the moisture levels of your hair and scalp. They are designed to rinse off excess dirt, oil, and pollutants. Balancing curly hair shampoos are loaded with proteins, vitamins, and moisturizers like aloe vera to restore your hair.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Anti-dandruff curly hair shampoo&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Curly hair is more prone to a flaky scalp and excessive damage. This condition increases during the winters. You must get an anti-dandruff curly hair shampoo to eliminate the flakiness in your hair. However, you may need to consult a dermatologist if the situation does not go away.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style=font-weight:400>Conclusion&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Curly hair is a luscious and attractive part of your look. However, curls require a lot of maintenance and care to achieve a healthy structure. You need to look at your scalp, the type of curls you have, and the ingredients used in the shampoo. We reviewed the best curly hair shampoos in 2022 that can leave your hair looking thick, healthy, shiny, and strong. It is imperative to look at your scalp type and length before buying a suitable product.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=review-faqs__title>People Also Asked</h2>What should you avoid in curly hair shampoos?<p><span style=font-weight:400>Curly hair shampoos can differ in terms of ingredients, but the things you don't want in your shampoo are sulfates and silicone.&nbsp;</span></p>Do I need a complete kit with curly hair shampoos?<p><span style=font-weight:400>Although using a complete hair care kit is advised, you should avoid excessive moisturizing from conditioners and hair masks in case of an oily scalp.&nbsp;</span></p>Are all curly hair shampoos excessively fragrant?<p><span style=font-weight:400>Not all curly hair shampoos are excessively fragrant, especially ones recommended medically by dermatologists.&nbsp;</span></p><img width=64 height=64 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/HL_social.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <a href=# title="Posts by HollywoodLife Reviews" class="author url fn" rel=author>HollywoodLife Reviews</a> HollywoodLife For over a decade Hollywood Life has been a leading source of celebrity, entertainment, and pop culture news.
