DeAnna told Us that<a href=#> she was “mind-blown” when her ex agreed to be the lead again.</a></p><p>“He had always said to me he would never do it again. He was like, ‘I am so glad to be done with this. I wouldn’t want to do this again. I wouldn’t put my family through this,’” she told Us. “And then, sure enough, I found out he was doing it again because the producers called. In the first episode of his second season, they had Jenni and I come back because we were engaged, both of us, you know, oddly at the same time to be married to someone else. I guess in a way to bring it all full circle. … He went from being the most hated Bachelor to the most loved Bachelor.”</p><p>Brad, who revealed on the show that he went to therapy in between seasons to work on his commitment issues, found a connection with <a href=#><strong>Emily Maynard</strong></a> and proposed to the Southern Belle during the 2011 finale. Their engagement was short-lived, however, and they announced their split four months after the show finished airing.</p><p>As ABC revisited Brad’s seasons of The Bachelor in July 2020 as part of<a href=#> The Bachelor: The Greatest Seasons — Ever!,</a> the bar owner confirmed that he would never look for love on the reality show again.</p><p>“I will not do it a third time,” he said in a sneak peek for the episode. “I promise you.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Listen to Here For the Right Reasons to get inside scoop about the Bachelor franchise and exclusive interviews from contestants!<strong><br></strong></strong></p><p>Scroll through for an update on the biggest names from season 11 and 15 of The Bachelor:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BXv6KwjLCmppmToMBuv8Saqqimo2K8p3nToZxmmpGYtaa4zqtksKCVp7JurdGeZK2gla56r7vWaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taco-toppings.html><span>←</span><span>25 Taco Toppings for Your Next Taco Bar</span></a>
