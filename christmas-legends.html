To satisfy this hunger, he crafted a disguise out of straw and waited by the roadside. To passersby, he looked like nothing more than a scarecrow.</p><p>One day, a young boy passed by the seemingly innocuous scarecrow, which suddenly sprang to life and grabbed him. Trapp, in his disguise, then stabbed the boy in the stomach with a sharpened stick and dragged the lifeless body back to his mountain lair.</p><p>There, he sliced the boy’s body into pieces and roasted it over a fire. In a stroke of divine intervention, however, Trapp never got to feast on the human meat as lightning took his life. But his spirit, supposedly, lived on.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-406571 alt="Christmas In Alsace" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/christmas-in-alsace.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-406571 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>“Christmas In Alsace” depicts the Christkindel, the Child of Christ, wearing a crown of candles, followed along by Hans Trapp. In legend, the Christkindel visits children terrorized by Trapp and instills in them hope.</span></p><p>Mythic though this tale is, the legend of Hans Trapp actually originated with a real man, a knight named Hans von Trotha, who lived from 1450 to 1503. Von Trotha commanded two castles in Palatine, but became embroiled in a disagreement with a local abbot over some of the items in one of them.</p><p>When the abbot refused to concede some of the property over to von Trotha, the knight constructed a dam that cut off the water supply to Weissenburg nearby. The dam was eventually destroyed, and, much like in the story of Hans Trapp, the Pope himself intervened and excommunicated von Trotha.</p><p>Von Trotha, however, continued to live a wealthy life in the French royal court, unlike his folktale counterpart. He also, as far as history can tell, did not eat the flesh of children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyktNGiqq2lkah6rbHGnqWdq19p</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./where-is-rapper-iggy-azalea-now.html><span>←</span><span>Where Is Rapper Iggy Azalea Now?</span></a>
