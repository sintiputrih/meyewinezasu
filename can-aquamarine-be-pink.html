<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Can aquamarine be pink?</h1></header><section class=post-content><span><span>Aquamarine is a beryl a beryllium aluminum silicate mineral, which includes, emerald (green), green beryl (lighter non chromium green), <b>morganite (pink to peach)</b>, heliodore (yellow to golden yellow), bixbite (pink to red), goshenite (colorless).</span></span><h2>What is the rarest color of aquamarine?</h2>Aquamarine's color range is very narrow: It can be blue, very slightly greenish blue, greenish blue, very strongly greenish blue, or green-blue. The gem's most valuable color is a dark blue to slightly greenish blue with moderately strong intensity.<h2>How can you tell if aquamarine is real?</h2>The best way to identify a real aquamarine stone is by looking at its colour. In its natural form, they have a pale blue colour, which is similar to seawater. They may have a slight green or yellow tint as well. Naturally occurring gems have excellent clarity and transparency.<h2>Can aquamarine be red?</h2>Light to emerald green, light to deep sky-blue, blue-green, yellow, pink, purple, red, orange, brown, colorless, white, and gray. May also be multicolored blue, green, yellow, or white, and may also have deeper color highlights on one crystal end.<h2>Why is my aquamarine not blue?</h2>There is a mineral species known as beryl. If, and only if, iron impurities cause a piece of beryl to appear blue to blue-green can it be called an aquamarine. If beryl is any other color, it gets a different name.<h2>Price Comparison (Most Expensive Substance)</h2><p></p><h2>Can aquamarine be purple?</h2>And, as with amethyst, you can use heat and other radiation to tweak the colors, although you won't manage to make yourself a purple aquamarine.

Aquamarine is related to emerald, since both belong to the gemstone family of Beryls.<h2>Is aquamarine more expensive than Amethyst?</h2>Gemstone prices can be undoubtedly confusing.
