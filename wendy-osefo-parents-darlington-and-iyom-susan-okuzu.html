In addition to being an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Education, she also is the main cast member of The Real Housewives of Potomac. Not only Wendy but her family also is equally famous among among Bravo TV fans. So, in the rest of the writing, we decided to bring to you a tell-all about her parents.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Wendy Osefo Parents?</strong></h3><p>Wendy Odefo’s mother has appeared in a total of 8 episodes of The Real Housewives of Potomac&nbsp;between 2020 and 2023. The same can not be said about Wendy’s father Darlington Okuzu, who named her “Wendy” after a fast food restaurant he worked at. Let’s keep reading and find out more about them.</p><h3><strong>Meet Iyom Susan Okuzu, Wendy Osefo’s Mother</strong></h3><p>Iyom Susan Okuzu, AKA Susan Chuk or Susan Chuk Okuzu, was born on 13 October 1958. So, she turned 65 years old in 2023.</p><p>On last year’s Mother’s Day, Wendy took to her social media to confess to her mommy and sister that there is no her without them. “Thank you for everything you sacrificed, every smile you put on my face, every word of affirmation, every hug. You two are the definition of not only motherhood but love. Happy Mother’s Day!!”, she further added next to pictures of all three of them together.</p><p>Wendy’s mom can be found on her IG <a href=#>@iyomokuzu</a>&nbsp;and on ‘Iyom Susan Okuzu’ <a href=#>Facebook</a>.</p><p>Lately, amid a “false” attack on Wendy and her family, Wendy’s mother has been particularly backed by RHOP fans. This happened after Ashley Darby, who is also from Nigeria, accused her co-star Wendy of being from the “cursed” Osu tribe. Fans especially detected the fact that Ashley brought up Wendy’s mom.</p><p>An in-law of Wendy Osefo dished about Wendy’s family being the Western equivalent of the “wrong side of the tracks.” She said her family and their ancestors have had bad reputations because of evils stemming from past generations, and are essentially cursed. Of course, Wendy denied these claims.</p><p>Last year, there was a similar heaviness in the Real Housewives air when Wendy and her mom, who inspired her new memoir, Tears of My Mother, had spat with Mia Thornton.</p><h3><strong>Meet Darlington Okuzu, </strong><strong>Wendy Osefo’s Father</strong></h3><p>Wendy Osefo’s father Darlington Okuzu who was reportedly born in January 1954 is no more. Had he been still around, he would have maybe reached the age of 69 in 2023.</p><p>The last time was recorded in some church bulletin in May 2012, he was sick and receiving medical attention.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>How Long Were Wendy Osefo’s Parents Married?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Wendy Osefo’s parents were married until one of them passed away. Wendy’s mom continued to mention her relationship status as ‘widowed’ even at the time of this writing.</p><p>“My parents came to this country with nothing. My dad worked at a fast food restaurant and one day he found out that he was being promoted to manager,” Wendy recalled on The Real Housewives of Potomac’s November 8, 2023, episode. “He was so happy that to thank this country for giving him the opportunity to be a manager, he named his second daughter after that restaurant: Wendy.”</p><p>She added, “I am literally the embodiment of the American dream.”</p><ul><li><h4><strong>How Many Kids Did Wendy Osefo’s Parents Have?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Wendy Osefo’s parents gave birth to two more kids, a son and a daughter. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based Jordan Okuzu can be found on IG <a href=#>@kevlarjenner</a>. On his LinkedIn, he mentioned working as a video editor/director and recording artist at ANDA Records LLC&nbsp;since February 2021. Also, it appears, he is supposed to get his bachelor’s degree in cinematography and film/video production from Temple University in May 2024. Not to miss, Jordan also appeared in an episode of&nbsp;RHOP&nbsp;in 2022.</p><p>The other is Yvonne Umezurike Ozuzu. She turned 42 years old in May 2023. Also known by Dr. Yvonne, she is a podiatrist in Baltimore. Since August 2019, she has been the President of the Maryland Board of Podiatry. All along she has also been working as an online marketing specialist. Between 2019 and 2023, she appeared in a total of 2 episodes of RHOP.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Were Wendy Osefo’s Parents From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Wendy Osefo’s mom originally hails from Nimo, Anambra, Nigeria. As of 2023 though, she had been residing in Baltimore, Maryland.</p><p>About her parents, Wendy once said they came to the United States with nothing. She further explained that her dad worked at a fast-food restaurant and one day he found out that he was being promoted to manager. So, Wendy said, he was so happy that to thank this country for giving him the opportunity to be a manager, he named Wendy after that restaurant.</p><p>It is “exquisitely drawn” in a book called&nbsp;Mother Daughter Me&nbsp;that&nbsp;Wendy’s mother arrived in the United States from Nigeria with two things: a single suitcase and the fierce determination to make a better life for herself and her future family. Indeed, it is also described that she succeeded by starting by working in a fast-food restaurant and ultimately becoming the director of nursing at a major metropolitan hospital. This book details the intense bond that Wendy has with her mother and explores how her Nigerian upbringing affected her life, success, and role as a parent.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmsJ2emcZuu9KenahloJa%2FprrTrGSdmaKhtq%2Bz06ilZpmemXqqxc6mZKyto5a7brvKrrGuZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./could-exercise-pills-help-create-healthier-society-irisin-locamidazole.html><span>←</span><span>Could exercise pills help create a healthier society?</span></a>
