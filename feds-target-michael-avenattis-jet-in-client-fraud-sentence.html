Client 2 is <strong>Alexis Gardner</strong>, whom Avenatti represented in a mediation against her former boyfriend, professional basketball player <strong>Hassan Whiteside</strong>, and was one of five clients who testified against Avenatti.</p><p>His signed waiver states that he “expressly, freely and voluntarily forfeits all right, title, and interest” in the jet.</p><p>Avenatti, who is currently in <a href=#>prison</a> following convictions in <a href=#>two New York prosecutions</a>, is slated to be sentenced in the Central District of California later this year on Oct. 3 at 9 a.m. Pacific Time.</p><p>This is a developing story.</p><p>Read the full filing, below.</p><p>Have a tip we should know? <a href=#><span class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=2a5e435a596a464b5d4b444e495843474f04494547>[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX5uypb%2BMrZirn5Wpeq61wqGYnqRdlsOmusCtq6KrXZ%2BytXnIp2ScpJmau7V5xauYrpxdqLKvwMSnmp5n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bionce-amaya-cortez-missing-texas-woman-found-dead-in-mexico-after-sending-chilling-text-to-mom.html><span>←</span><span>Who was Bionce Amaya Cortez?
