As their names imply, sensors take in information through their senses, and intuitives take in information through their <b>intuition</b>. Sensors use their five senses to take in information about the world around them.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-intuition-personality></span>What is intuition personality?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Intuition</b> (N)<p><b>Intuitive</b> people live in the future and are immersed in the world of possibilities. They process information through patterns and impressions. <b>Intuitive</b> people value inspiration and imagination. They gather knowledge by reading between the lines.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-difference-between-sensing-and-feeling></span>What is the difference between sensing and feeling?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>They represent two different areas of cognition. <b>Sensing</b> is the concept Of self and immediate surroundings. Especially when it comes to aesthetics. <b>Feeling</b> is your emotional state and whether you pick up on other people’s or yourself first.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-change-from-sensing-to-intuition></span>How do you change from sensing to intuition?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Sensors</b> can develop their <b>intuition</b> better by learning to think outside the box. Instead of just focusing on what the painting is, ask what the painting means, what the artist is trying to say, how it relates to your life, what meaning or message it has for you.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-do-intuitives-hate-sensors></span>Why do Intuitives hate sensors?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A lot of people in the sub use MBTI as an explanation as to why they can’t get along with others. (Ex., thinkers thinking feelers are too sensitive, <b>intuitives</b> thinking <b>sensors</b> are not intellectually deep enough for them, etc.) It’s because in the non mbti world, everyone <b>hates intuitives</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-sensing-in-personality-type></span>What is sensing in personality type?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In the terminology of <b>personality type</b>, <b>sensors</b> are hands-on people who prefer to process information about the world in terms of what they can see, hear, feel, touch, and taste.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-4-personality-types></span>What are the 4 personality types?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A study published in Nature Human Behaviour reveals that there are four <b>personality types</b> — average, reserved, role-model and self-centered — and these findings might change the thinking about <b>personality</b> in general.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-rarest-personality-type></span>What is the rarest personality type?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>If you happened to fall into the INFJ <b>personality type</b>, you’re a <b>rare</b> breed; only 1.5 percent of the general population fits into that category, making it the <b>rarest personality type</b> in the world.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-are-infjs-so-attractive></span>Why are INFJs so attractive?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>INFJs</b> have a strong intuition that helps us to understand people on an emotional level and we like to help others in order to make this world a better place for everyone. This combination makes <b>INFJ</b> women extremely <b>attractive</b> because we want to create something meaningful with our lives.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-rarest-female-personality-type></span>What is the rarest female personality type?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>“INTJ is the <b>rarest personality type</b> for women.” In fact, at about 0.5 percent of the population, INTJ women might be the <b>rarest</b> of any gender/<b>type</b> combination (perhaps only rivaled by INFJ men). That means, as an INTJ <b>woman</b>, you could easily go your whole life and meet only a few other women like you.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-4-personality-colors></span>What are the 4 personality colors?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>There are four basic <b>personality</b> types, each with a <b>color</b> that reflects their main characteristics: Dominant Red, Planner Blue, Charismatic Yellow, and Stable Green. All can be exceptional leaders if they work from their strengths.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-a-blue-personality-type></span>What is a blue personality type?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Those with <b>Blue</b> color <b>personality</b> strengths tend to be enthusiastic, sympathetic, communicative, compassionate, idealistic, sincere and imaginative. <b>Blue personality</b> temperaments can be good listeners, talk about the possibilities and like to do new things. Conflict or disharmony can upset a <b>Blue</b>.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46doJ%2Belaeyr6%2FEZpmerKeasq950p6lrKGenHqiusNmoKespZ7BqrvNaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christen-from-bachelor-in-paradise-was-somehow-not-aware-of-scallop-fingers-during-this-key-moment-2460396.html><span>←</span><span>Christen From 'Bachelor In Paradise' Was Somehow Not Aware Of &amp;quot;Scallop Fingers During This Key Mo</span></a>
