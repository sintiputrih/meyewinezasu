In 1993, Matador Records released Exile in Guyville, which won acclaim for its articulate mix of sexual candor and jibes at patriarchy. Ten years later, when she released Liz Phair on a major label, Pitchfork gave the album a rare <a href=#>0.0 review</a>, dismissing it as “hyper-commercialized teen-pop.” But Phair has never put much stock in typical markers of success. In October, she’ll release Horror Stories, the first of two planned memoirs that forsake rock-star gossip for keen, lyrical ruminations on key moments in her life. “It’s hard to tell the truth about ourselves,” Phair writes, but “our flaws and our failures make us relatable, not unlovable.”<strong></strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck049hfrp001s3a64a0u8tit9@published data-word-count=108><strong>Let’s start with something you tweeted earlier this year: “Remind me to tell you about the time I had no idea I had a two-month tour booked until my friend told me over lunch at the Chateau Marmont one day.”</strong><strong><br></strong>That really happened. When I’m not working, I safeguard my time to go into a dream state and not have to think about the commercialization of my art or the commodification of myself. I take “Liz Phair,” I put her on a hanger, kind of like Mr. Rogers, and I put her away in a closet. I’m not “Liz Phair” anymore. I become the observer rather than the observed.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck049hfu3001t3a64lle3bg7d@published data-word-count=52>[In spring 2018], my friend Caroline had come into town, and we were having lunch. She said, “I’m coming to see you next month in Nashville.” I’m like, “I’m not playing Nashville next month.” She said, “I bought tickets. You’re playing Exile in Guyville in its entirety.” I was like, “Wait. What?”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck049hg72001u3a64girtj7cm@published data-word-count=107>This cold sweat went through my body. A couple of business calls must have come in and they wanted to book some shows, and I said, “Good, just do it.” No one actually told me when those dates were. It was two months of dates!&nbsp;I have stage fright anyway, and I had to go, in less than three weeks, from not having toured in years to playing the entire record of Guyville. When the tour started, I sobbed on my way to the first gig. I didn’t remember how to be that person. It took a few shows before I could be onstage and not freak out.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck049hhbg001v3a64eno75bp4@published data-word-count=57><strong>The bifurcation you describe, where the artist is on one side and the public figure is on another, is that a defense mechanism?</strong><strong><br></strong>Yes, against self-consciousness. I can’t be an artist and think of myself as a star. I can’t do the two at the same time. Some people are born with a theatricality that I don’t have.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck049hhf5001w3a64993xc6ct@published data-word-count=81><strong>The Exile song that pops up in my head most often isn’t one of the famous songs, but “Canary.”</strong><br>Interesting! That’s one of the more personal songs. It’s very revealing about the simmering repression I lived in, the soup I lived in, before I made music. I had a people-pleasing personality. And my older brother was in trouble so much that I was the designated good child. There wasn’t much room for my resentments and rebellion. That built up until I exploded.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck049him5001x3a64haxcwviu@published data-word-count=72><strong>How did you explode?</strong><br>I stopped going to class in <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-1 tabindex=0>my senior year of high school.</span> I’d been an almost straight-A student. I remember being in geometry class, and I kept getting 100s. They graded on a curve, and a guy I had a crush on, who I thought liked me, wasn’t doing so well in class. He turned around one time and looked at me with such resentment. He hated my guts.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck049hirf001y3a6446s40q3a@published data-word-count=35>I felt like there was not going to be a payoff for being a good girl, or being smart, or going to an Ivy League school. I remember thinking, Fuck it, I’m done with this.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck049hiyk001z3a64flf3mj6n@published data-word-count=83><strong>You had an epiphany that being polite and industrious wasn’t going to pay off for you?</strong><strong><br></strong>Or bring me fulfillment. Let’s throw the complication in here: I had a 15- to 20-year regret period of wishing I’d stayed on the straight and narrow. My life became getting onstage, when I was never someone who should’ve been onstage to begin with. The one thing that I really didn’t want to do became my whole job! And there was no way to get out of it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> Liz Phair on tour for Exile in Guyville at the shuttered music venue Lounge Ax in Chicago, Illinois.<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck049hj7i00203a642jpjzetp@published data-word-count=39>Oberlin was the best school that would take me after I stopped going to high school.

My mother went to Wellesley. My dad went to Yale. They’re intellectuals. The life of the mind, literature, theater, the symphony are all very meaningful to them. They had a good life, and they wanted that for me. But because <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-3 tabindex=0>I was adopted,</span> they took a somewhat hands-off approach.

It’s not that they don’t deserve me — it’s just … and I still find myself saying to men, “You’re not listening.” There’s something about the society of men that thinks they have it all dialed in. “We made this.

Death, dying, and illness were things I knew about. It gave me a perspective that music is one of the good things in life. There’s no need to parse it to death.

John Henderson, who ran the label Feel Good All Over, had been my roommate in Chicago. He heard <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-7 tabindex=0>my Girly-Sound tapes,</span> and I was stuck living at home. He’s like, “Give me $100 a month and you can stay in my second bedroom.” And then he would sort of My Fair Lady me. “Listen to this music. Now listen to this.” I spent a lot of time going to see cool bands, standing in the corner and smoking cigarettes, so I’d look tougher and cooler. All the men who mansplained music to me made me better.

You should sign me.” I had one goal: to show these indie-rock boys that I had listened to all the music they gave me, and just because I liked the Police and R.E.M. and Madonna didn’t mean I couldn’t make indie rock. That was my goal, to be like, “Shut the fuck up about Green River versus Fugazi.

At Oberlin, that was part of the activism, that the female voice is the least listened to and carried the least authority. I even sped up the tracks on Girly-Sound to make myself sound even more like a little girl. My theory was, if I say the dirtiest things in the world, but like a little girl, will anyone actually hear it? That was the game I was playing.

It feels like I understand the male mind better than some people. This whole idea that men just want sex, I don’t think that’s true. I think they’re actually looking for intimacy.

I wanted to contribute.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck049hro700493a64m15gqk23@published data-word-count=30><strong>What’s happening in the Whitechocolatespaceegg song “Only Son”?</strong><br>That’s brother.

My parents loved us to within an inch of our lives. We had a secure and stable household. We were the disruptive elements. Mom and dad have it dialed in, which can give you a bad complex.
