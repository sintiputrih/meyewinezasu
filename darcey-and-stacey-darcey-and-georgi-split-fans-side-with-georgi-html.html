During a recent <a href=#>Darcey & Stacey</a> episode, Darcey and Georgi <a href=#>called it quits</a>, with Darcey Silva putting the final nail in the coffin.

The Darcey & Stacey star was not happy with how the interaction went. In fact, Darcey and Georgi split up over the phone, with Darcey making the final call to end it.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_41>“I wasn’t quite sure what kind of mood or demeanor you were gonna be in because the goodbye that you gave me when you left Connecticut wasn’t very nice. It was very hurtful. Do you even love me, Georgi?” Darcey asked.</p><p id=par-4_71>She went on to add that she feels as if they no longer share love in their relationship, and that she thinks Georgi treats her like he hates her. She went on to add that she is hurt by the fact that he <a href=#>reached out to Jesse Meester</a>, despite the fact that she reached out to his ex first, and several times. Georgi explained that he felt unheard by Darcey Silva.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_45>“That’s not right. You’re never trying to understand the things you do, how it’s affecting me, it’s always about you. … So do you understand the things you say here that’s how it affects me, how it hurt me, do you understand that?” he asked.</p><p id=par-6_47>“I don’t want a relationship like this, I deserve more. I don’t think you treat me like how a fiance should. And you have plenty of time in the apartment before I get back to figure things out, but I can’t do this anymore,” Darcey Silva replied.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-darcey-stacey-fans-side-with-georgi-rusev>‘Darcey & Stacey’ fans side with Georgi Rusev</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/darceyandgeorgi1.png><p id=par-7_56>Darcey & Stacey fans aren’t exactly thrilled with Darcey Silva, who claimed the breakup saw her “standing in her power.” Instead, they seem to feel as if Georgi made a good point — that Darcey is always discussing her own feelings and letting them crowd her relationship with Georgi, instead of looking at it two ways.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_71>“Darcey is a walking cliche at this point. She says the same things over and over that they have no meaning because she doesn’t even know the meanings of what she’s saying. She also accuses Georgi anytime he tries to stand up for himself or he actually opens up of ‘triggering her’ and always uses that to end the conversation so she won’t have to take accountability,” wrote one <a href=#>frustrated Redditor</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_15>Another user felt that Darcey Silva was the hypocrite amid the Darcey and Georgi breakup.</p><p id=par-10_57>“I used to feel bad for her but not anymore. She is such a hypocrite. Always crying cause ‘all men are so bad’ and she’s ‘just looking for love’ bla bla but she is the one who plays stupid games and is mean as f*ck. Can’t stand her anymore. Poor Georgi, he looked really hurt,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">they wrote</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_52>“I wasn’t a huge fan of Georgi until the last two episodes and he’s 100% right about Darcey just pushing him away while requiring the world. … She has been hurt and is taking that out on all of her partners instead of working through her issues,” wrote <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">another Redditor</a> in part.</p><h2 id=h-are-darcey-and-georgi-still-together>Are Darcey and Georgi still together?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-12_18>Despite their dramatic breakup on Darcey & Stacey, there are signs that Darcey and Georgi are still together.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_18>On August 2nd, 2021, Georgi Rusev posted a photo of himself smiling next to Darcey Silva on <a href=#>Facebook</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-14_22>“The power of love is stronger than everything else,” Georgi captioned the photo.
