Well, <a href=# rel=noopener>Kismile </a>has developed these electric fireplaces based on infrared technology. This means that the heat production is even, and you save a lot of energy since there is no need to put a more substantial request on it to get an entire room warm.</p><p>And this makes it safer to use since you are not compromising the electric fireplace to have an overcharge or produce a short circuit of some kind.</p><p>Talking about technology, it also comes with a remote controller that allows you to use it even if you are 8 meters away from the fireplace. So as you can see, this electric fireplace is energy efficient, safe, and really easy to use! And those are just some of the benefits; let’s see some more.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lh6.googleusercontent.com/QdAqg6jbTFRYW-irb64skvvjWonvUrJ2Cjc7T7IPJTtI3oSlfFUyns5aQwi5CghmLsHYykVIHgnAvgkT8AGPQTV1eMeQqAWRJ5jNfOrk4HWYAH_oGGuYpXoSUXgsHyfOvhfK-RAQ6AIo3H0i5ATtIYN9v-2lCn9snd23hzGH-K3Tiy29pyETSsLv8QRj width=624 height=401 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Heating Modes</h2><p>Everybody knows you can’t control how much heat a classic fireplace generates. And that is a plus when it comes to <a href=# rel=noopener>choosing an electric fireplace</a>! You have normal mode and sleep mode.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Normal Mode</h3><p>In normal mode, the fireplace generates a 3D flame, the same flame you can control by selecting between 6 different brightness levels and five different flame speeds. You can make it look any way you want to! Isn’t that amazing? You bet it is.</p><p>Also, you have up to 16 different color combinations for that flame, so you can choose and design the flame that fits you best. You have different colors, like red, yellow, orange, and blue, so if you have been waiting for an electric stove that can give you a realistic look, search no more.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lh3.googleusercontent.com/4kiL6NRk43H_Q1d8kM31muxSLHdtDMvowMDO7MZjPJnQc4b8q02GikFujSklEfQJ7wn1jTrwijHRjj2M4SvLyWu-Q2rG6b91JmixPNoMgZ0EdgGDers6eLYKYifObE3lgZMU7GMbugOOpFDeDYXBlubqoijLJHxVeCYzAg8WMZt7mxmKrbqSVJof39ke width=624 height=373 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Sleep Mode</h3><p>In this mode, every light of the electric fireplace will turn off, but the heating function will still be working. This way, you can even save more energy making it more efficient.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Safety Protection</h2><p>Has it ever happened to you that it is freezing at night, and you turn on your fan to warm you up so you can sleep tight? But when you turn it on it starts making noise, so your peaceful evening becomes a warm nightmare.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, if that is the case, don’t worry. It has solved the issue. This fireplace has a powerful integrated silencer; since it is small, you can enjoy quiet warmth on those horrible winter nights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And if you start feeling like it is getting too hot, worry not. The electric stove comes with an overheating protection system. If it overheats, the furnace will automatically shut off and cut the power supply to ensure you are safe around it.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Design</h2><p>If you are a person that loves classic style or vintage stuff, you will love this electric fireplace design. The structure is made of complete steel, making it stable and vintage, and the system is based on the medieval European Church’s architecture.&nbsp;</p><p>So, as you can see, this will fit perfectly in your living room. You are turning the mood not just with its looks but also with the evenly distributed heat. So, if you plan to have a date at home, this little buddy has to be around to make it perfect.
