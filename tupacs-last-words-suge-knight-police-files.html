Knight provided no information to aid our investigation."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000579854436-1.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/02/NINTCHDBPICT000439525639-e1581455924274.jpg><p>In his “voluntary statement”, Suge claimed he never saw the murderers, their car or had any reason to believe the West Coast rap pair were targets - despite them both being involved in a fight with Orlando Anderson - widely believed to be Tupac's killer - just hours earlier.</p><p>Detective Becker, who was leading the probe for the Las Vegas Metro Police, was often met with a series of short "Yes" and "No" answers during their question and answer session on<span> September 11 - and the detective noted in the files that Suge had failed to meet with him several times to conduct the taped interview.</span></p><p>Suge also denied that the murder was part of the long running East and West Coast rap wars, which escalated into gang violence during the 1990s.</p><p>Asked why Tupac was gunned down, Suge said: “I don’t understand it to this day.”</p><p>In the interview Suge, then aged 31, boasted about Death Row Records’ success hinting that other labels were “jealous.”</p><p>He said: “All labels target Death Row because we sell more records" adding that his competitors “want to be recognized.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/04/tp-US-image-Tupac-document-3.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/03/Tupac_Orlando.jpg><p>The 31 page transcript, which has many redacted or blanked out passages, was just one of the explosive files obtained by The Sun on Wednesday.</p><p>Other allegations in the 243 page filing include that Suge Knight was the intended target for the Tupac "hit".</p><p>According to another transcript, a witness named Gregory Johnson told police in a jail house interview that a fellow inmate - whose name is redacted - told him he went to Vegas to carry out a "hit" on Suge because he allegedly "put a contract on to... have every Crip in Compton killed and some people got hit".</p><p>Johnson added: "He either said [they] bombed on...Tupac and them or ...dropped on them, but he was kind of disappointed that he wasn't able to...blast Suge."</p><p>The Sun reached out to an attorney for Suge for comment on these allegations.</p><p>The file release comes after The Sun revealed a former LAPD detective, who worked on the Tupac murder case, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">urged Vegas cops to arrest gangster Keffe D</a>&nbsp;over the rapper's death - calling him a "self-confessed murderer".</p><p><a href=#>Greg Kading</a>&nbsp;says that Las Vegas police are aware of Keffe D Davis, 56, who has admitted to cops, on documentaries and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in a book</a>, that his nephew Orlando shot Tupac and that he was an accomplice, and simply need to arrest him.
