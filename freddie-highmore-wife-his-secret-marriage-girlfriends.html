<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Freddie Highmore | Wife, His Secret Marriage, &amp;amp; Girlfriends</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>For many years, Freddie Highmore wife has been the focus of media speculation. While Freddie Highmore has been in the public eye since he was a child, he has always sought to keep his personal life private. When it comes to divulging his behind-the-scenes existence, he is undoubtedly a man of few words. In reality, many people still regard him as a single man.</strong></p><p>But a few years ago, he surprised his admirers by announcing that he’d married quietly. However, the English actor has never provided any additional information since then. There are also a few photographs of him and his wife together.</p><p>So, just who is Mrs. Highmore? Read that, as well as other details such as how the couple met, how their wedding went, when they actually married, and so on.</p><h2><span id=The_First_Time_We8217ve_Heard_of_Freddie_Highmore8217s_Wife>The First Time We’ve Heard of Freddie Highmore’s Wife</span></h2><p>During his appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live in September 2021, Highmore disclosed the news of his marriage and wife for the first time. After host Jimmy Kimmel pointed out the new ring that the British actor was sporting, Freddie reacted to the topic of his marital status.</p><p>The Finding Neverland star said that he married his wife that summer. In terms of the big news, Highmore stated,</p><p>It is, indeed, a wedding ring. Yes, I married.</p><p>The Vault actor went on to say,</p><p>It’s amusing. People have been asking me whether I’m married since I’ve been wearing this ring, so I thought I’d explain.</p><p>While discussing the news, Highmore cast shade, saying that he wasn’t going to jump up and down on the couch on the talk program to convey his delight.</p><p>The remark was a jab at Mission Impossible star Tom Cruise’s notorious jumping on the couch scene during his 2005 interview with Oprah Winfrey. Cruise reacted in this manner while discussing his own marriage to his then-wife, Katie Holmes.</p><p>He explained that he is as happy as a Brit can be and that he is married to a “very wonderful woman now, so yes, I feel very happy.” Highmore also disclosed that his wife, like him, is British. The actor went on to say that he was having difficulty accepting words and vocab like “married man,” which seemed extremely ancient to him.</p><p>Freddie, Bertie’s brother, said he and his wife hadn’t actually used it yet, but when people asked, they just showed their rings.</p><h2><span id=What_Happened_When_Freddie_Highmore_Met_His_Wife>What Happened When Freddie Highmore Met His Wife?</span></h2><p>While it has been over a year since Highmore announced his marriage on Jimmy Kimmel, the actor is still hesitant to speak publicly about his wife or reveal the story of their relationship.</p><p>The former child star hasn’t revealed much about his marital life. Even during his appearance with Jimmy Kimmel, the actor refused to reveal any wedding details. Obviously, the wedding photos have yet to be released.</p><p>Highmore’s wife, on the other hand, has a name: Klarissa Munz. Once again, the actor from London has not revealed how he met Munz. It is also unknown how old Highmore’s wife is.</p><p>Munz, like her actor husband, is said to be in her late twenties to early thirties, and she and Highmore met while the latter was filming A&E’s Bates Motel (between 2012 and 2013). They presumably met at Cambridge University, where August Rush was studying at the time.</p><h2><span id=Freddie_Highmore8217s_wife_is_a_Cambridge_graduate_and_a_web_developer>Freddie Highmore’s wife is a Cambridge graduate and a web developer.</span></h2><p>According to Enstars.com, Kunz, Highmore’s wife, studied theology and religious studies at Cambridge. She is now a web developer. Munz and Freddie first appeared together in public in 2018 at the Golden Globes. They later appeared on the set of Bates Motel together.</p><p>Another event where Klarissa and Highmore allegedly attended as a couple was the Critics Choice Awards, which took place in Rome while the latter was filming the 2021 series, Leonardo.</p><h2><span id=Other_Females_Freddie_Highmore_dated_before_he_married>Other Females Freddie Highmore dated before he married.</span></h2><p>Prior to his present marriage, Highmore was in the spotlight for allegedly dating Dakota Fanning and Abigail Breslin. However, the actor never addressed the rumor. As a result, for a long time, many people imagined he was a single man. Nonetheless, he apparently had relationships with a number of women in the past.</p><h2><span id=Mrs_Sarah_Bolger>Mrs. Sarah Bolger</span></h2><p>Bolger and Highmore appeared together in the 2008 fantasy/family flick Spider Chronicles. They presumably met during the film’s audition.</p><p>The erstwhile purported couple allegedly spent a lot of time together following the incident and were allegedly girlfriend and boyfriend at one point. According to numerous sources, they divorced in 2009.</p><h2><span id=Dakota_Fanning>Dakota Fanning</span></h2><p>It all started with the Coraline actress Fanning when the media caught Highmore on a presumed dinner date in 2009. Later, the couple was pictured exiting II Cielo in Los Angeles.</p><p>However, neither of them revealed whether their relationship was serious.</p><h2><span id=Emma_Roberts>Emma Roberts</span></h2><p>In the 2011 rom-com film The Art Of Getting By, Roberts and Highmore played each other’s love interests. There were even allegations that the two had become more than friends while filming the picture.</p><p>Furthermore, Highmore told Teen Vogue in June 2011 that filming intimate sequences with Roberts was easier because of the close friendship they had built off-set.</p><h2><span id=Breslin_Abigail>Breslin, Abigail</span></h2><p>The relationship rumor involving the Little Miss Sunshine actress, Breslin, and Highmore was popular in 2016. However, neither the British actor nor the New York-born actress ever addressed the rumors openly.</p><p>Breslin is currently engaged to Ira Kunyansky, her longtime beau.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
