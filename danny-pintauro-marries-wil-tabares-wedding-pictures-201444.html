Who’s the Boss? alum Pintauro, 38, tied the knot with his boyfriend in an intimate beach ceremony on Thursday, April 3.</p><p>As previously reported, the Las Vegas-based couple <a href=# rel=noopener>said “I do”</a> in Dana Point, California, in front of friends, family, and even some fans, who were able to watch part of the festivities via Livestream. Both Pintauro and Tabares wore light-colored suits for their big day, with what appeared to be chrysanthemums tucked into their vest pockets. The reception was “beautiful,” too, a source said, adding that Tabares sang a special song for Pintauro. “It was all very sweet and romantic.”</p><p>“Everything went off without a hitch,” Pintauro, now a manager at a Las Vegas P.F. Chang’s, told <strong>Us </strong>of the afternoon. “The wedding was terrific, and everyone was so happy to be there. We had fun! We went into it with no stress or worries or cares, except to have a good time.”</p><p>Added his new husband, an entertainer and Cosmopolitan casino employee: “I never thought I would get married…I never thought I’d see the day that same-sex marriage would be legal, so it’s definitely a lifelong dream come true. The beautiful reality is starting to set in. This is one small step for man, one giant step for equality.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Danny-Pintauro-Marries-Wil-Tabares-2.jpg><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Tabares also reflected on the wedding on his website. “I sit here now reflecting back on yesterday’s events, and now I can see why everyone gets excited about getting married,” he wrote on Friday, April 4. “It was a magical experience and one that I will never forget for obvious reasons. My friends and family were there as well as Dan’s and I can’t thank each and every one of them enough for coming out to support us on our most important day together so far.”</p><p>“We didn’t get married for any political reasons, we got married because we love each other and want to spend the rest of our lives together,” he concluded. “I can’t see any other reason why we shouldn’t be allowed to do that legally.”</p><p><strong>Us</strong> exclusively confirmed the couple’s engagement last year. Pintauro, best known for playing Jonathan Bower on Who’s the Boss from 1984 to 1992, accepted Tabares’ video proposal in April 2013 during a Palm Springs getaway.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadmZ6jxm68yKermq2ipHqurdGroJ6rXay2rXnTmpmaqpWoerixw52gp59dpbakwNSrnKxlYmV%2BdYCTaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./danielle-staub-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Danielle Staub Net Worth 2024</span></a>
