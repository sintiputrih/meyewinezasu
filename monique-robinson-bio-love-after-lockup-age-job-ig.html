While the show explores her relationship with her boyfriend Derek, there is more to learn about her outside of the show. This article is about her children, and her job among other things.</p><p>So, join us and discover other details about Monique.</p><h3><strong>Love After Lockup: Are Monique Robinson And Derek Still Together?</strong></h3><p>A brand new season of Love After Lockup premiered on 16 December 2022, and one of the four couples that instantly grabbed viewers‚Äô attention was Monique Robinson and her inmate boyfriend Derek. Monique met Derek through a prison pen-pal group on Facebook. Monique after seeing Derek‚Äôs photo couldn‚Äôt help but send him a message.</p><p>In one clip Monique explained, ‚ÄúOne night, it was late, I couldn‚Äôt sleep, so I‚Äôm just scrolling on Facebook, clicking on things, and then somehow I came across a prison pen pal group.‚Äù</p><p>Derek also fell for Monique once they started communicating with each other and wanted to become serious. They are still together after two years. Their family disagrees, though. Even Monique‚Äôs friends are dissatisfied with her romantic life and her connection to Derek.</p><p>But, the catch for this couple is they haven‚Äôt met each other in person. Monique worries that their dynamic will change once Derek is out of prison. Derek is a fitness enthusiast, and Monique lied about having the same interest as him. So she worries about his response after they first meet.</p><p>Monique, though, gives Derek credit for her decision to have weight-loss surgery.</p><p>She also admitted to her friends that she is worried about what Derek will think of her when he gets out of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>prison</a> in a few days and meets her face-to-face for the first time ever. Monique explained to her friends, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm nervous. It does cross my mind, like what if, you know, I‚Äôm not what he imagined, or what if he [doesn‚Äôt] like me? I‚Äôm trying to think positive, but it‚Äôs hard when y‚Äôall are being so negative.‚Äù</p><p>Viewers who watched episodes of the new season didn‚Äôt hesitate a second to declare that Monique catfished Derek. Soon Monique also took to her IG to comment about the catfish allegations. She wrote, ‚ÄúNow I done let y‚Äôall play with me on this internet long enough. I hate how Love After Lockup trying to push this narrative like I‚Äôm catfishing a man in prison. I use filters on pics like every other woman. Also, I gave y‚Äôall plenty of pics to choose from when y‚Äôall did my intro and y‚Äôall did not use ONE full body pic.‚Äù</p><p>She added, ‚ÄúWhy is that??? Like I was sending nothing but filtered selfies for 2 1/2 years? üôÑ be fuckin fr!! I‚Äôve always been a confident BBW. Y‚Äôall cannot bully me or fat shame me because I know who tf I am!! Stop the bullshit.&nbsp; #loveafterlockup&nbsp; #loveafterlockupwetv.‚Äù</p><p>Are they still together? Only time will tell what Derek‚Äôs reaction will be though Monique appears to be a genuine person.</p><p>More about Monique, she was a mother once before. However, her child Maliah Char‚ÄôLeigh Robinson passed away on 27 January 2017 just three days after her birth. She made several posts about her daughter on her Instagram and shared the agonizing pain she felt from the loss of her daughter.</p><p>In one post she wrote, ‚ÄúI birthed you and lost you in 3 days, I often think about how my life would be if you were still here. I find myself constantly trying to imagine what u would look like now. If you were to look like me or your dad because I couldn‚Äôt stand him during my pregnancy.‚Äù</p><p>In 2022, Maliah would‚Äôve been 5 years old had she survived. She also has a son named KJ from her previous relationship who celebrated his 9th birthday on 3 August 2022. Her last marriage can be traced back to as recent <a href=#>as July 2020</a>.</p><p>In 2015, Monique wrote on her Facebook, ‚ÄúSOME OF YOU FEMALES ARE SO F**KIN CONFUSED!!!
