Over the years, they have basically watched each other grow from university students to full-time renovators.</p><p>But for those viewers wondering just how different their heights are, Erin is 5 ft 5, while Ben stands at a significant 6 ft 6 and 300 pounds. So, you don‚Äôt even need to see them next to each other to imagine how much taller he is!</p><p>Erin reaches Ben‚Äôs shoulder level, which is perfect when it comes to renovating homes. Ben can reach all of the higher points, such as adding in wooden shelves, while Erin can get to work on the graphic and visual elements lower down.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Erin Napier (@erinapier)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-their-shared-love-for-renovation>Their shared love for renovation</h2><p>Ben and Erin actually started out in fairly different industries, with hers in graphic design, while he worked in ministry and history. However, he quickly developed a passion for woodworking, which made total sense.</p><p>Together, they offer the perfect balance when it comes to home renovating. Visually, Erin‚Äôs talents are at hand, while Ben usually spends his time in his workshop creating sturdy pieces of furniture.</p><p>Laurel Mercantile Co. & Scotsman Co. flagship store is their store, where they both evenly contribute their talents. In 2018, the group expanded with a second location in Laurel with the added Scotsman General Store & Ben‚Äôs Woodshop.</p><p>Featuring Ben‚Äôs handmade woodworkings and gentlemen‚Äôs workwear, the store also has hip apparel, rustic furniture, and home accessories available for customers.
