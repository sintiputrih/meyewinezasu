We heard about the couple’s altercation from Season 1, which resulted in both of them going to jail. He called the police after Quad said she threw a bowl at him out of anger.</p><p>Still, their love for one another was sufficient to maintain their marriage. They tied the knot in 2012 and were wed for six years. Quad said, “I’ve been married to my husband for six years and I’ve been with him for ten years,” in an interview with Life & Style. Although it has been a long time, I will say this: If the time hasn’t been meaningful, it doesn’t matter how much time has passed.</p><p>They officially divorced in 2019 and have no children together.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-did-quad-and-dr-gregory-divorce><strong>Why Did Quad and Dr. Gregory Divorce?</strong></h2><p>The couple tried to discuss his emotional vacancy multiple times on camera throughout Married to Medicine’s first six seasons, but Dr. Gregory, a psychiatrist, always got up and left the conversation. Quad admitted to blocking his phone number when she would get angry. She also wasn’t pleased with his lack of support when she wanted to create a dog clothing line.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>A sore point was that Dr. Gregory was ready to have kids and Quad wasn’t. Quad ultimately filed for divorce in 2018 due to his alleged infidelity. Dr. Gregory admitted to accompanying a woman to a hotel room with a friend but claimed nothing happened during the Season 6 Married to Medicine reunion.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>The woman in question, Jackie Presley, spoke out with different details, saying he said he wasn’t married and the two had oral sex, which Dr. Gregory denied. She also sent a DM to Quad to share what happened after she realized he was on a reality show.</p><p>In Season 6, Quad came to terms with her husband’s infidelity, admitting that she believed Presley’s side of the story. Quad went on to tell Life & Style that she tried everything in her power to bring her failing marriage back to life. “We’ve tried marital counseling. I’ve bought books for us. I have written things down. I have also tried to lead by example. And now, you’ll see in the show that we have a marital focus group that we are a part of,” she said. “So, I’m literally trying everything that I can to salvage my marriage.”</p><p>The former couple also accused each other of abuse during the relationship. Their divorce was finalized in 2019.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-quad-dating-now><strong>Who is Quad Dating Now?</strong></h2><p>As of right now, Quad isn’t publicly dating anyone. Earlier this year on Sherri, she confirmed she was single. Though time will tell if that remains the same once Season 10 starts up …</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Meanwhile, Dr. Gregory has moved on and is newly married to his bride Lateasha. The couple tied the knot in April in Atlanta, and will be featured on the new season of Married to Medicine. In an Instagram discussion with Heavenly, Quad stated she felt disrespected with the return of Dr. Gregory on the show with his new wife in tow. The drama ensues.</p><p>Season 10 of Married to Medicine premieres on Sunday, Novemeber 5 at 9:15 p.m. ET/PT on Bravo.</p><p>Source:<a href=#>www.ghbase.com</a></p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunC91JqbZq%2BVl69utNSsmZqmlGK2tHnSoZxmpZGnv6qxw2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nashville-school-shooter-idd-as-audrey-hale.html><span>←</span><span>Nashville school shooter ID'd as Audrey Hale</span></a>
