After taking a trip there, Walker returned and according to the site, "contacted <a href=#>a group of his friends</a> to assist him in forming ROWW with the purpose of filling this unmet need" of skilled resources. Since then, the organization has helped victims of the Oklahoma City tornado in June, and other victims from natural disasters.</p><p>After attending the toy drive Saturday, titled "Winter Drive," Walker went for a drive in a red 2005 Porsche Carrera GT, which belonged to a friend, <a href=#>TMZ</a> reports. <a href=#>The Fast and the Furious actor</a> was the passenger when his friend lost control and slammed the vehicle into a tree.</p><p>The Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station confirmed to <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> in a statement that there were two fatalities in the traffic collision at approximately 3:30 p.m. The Los Angeles County Fire Department extinguished the fiery fire, but the victims were dead at the scene.</p><p>Hours before the crash, Walker took what would be one of his last photos with an entrepreneur, <strong>Bill Townsend</strong>. Shortly after the tragic news broke, Townsend shared the picture and a message on his <a href=#>Facebook page.</a></p><p>"I was just with him no more than 2 or 3 hours ago. Talking cars, he was so happy seeing all his friends get together to look at the cars," he wrote. "I hope it wasn't him in the wreck, but if it was, he would have passed doing something he loved, which is driving cars. The world lost an angel in Paul. He dedicated so much of his life to helping disadvantaged kids and people who are in need, with his charity recently assisting those in the tornadoes in the Midwest and the trauma in the Philippines."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He added: "Just today we had hundreds of toys donated for kids, all apart of Paul's charity. If this sad news indeed true I’m going to do whatever I can to keep Paul's goals for the charity alive."</p><p>In the photo, Walker had his hands in his pocket as he wore a black t-shirt, sunglasses, and donned some scruff. Walker had been gearing up the past few months to <a href=#>reprise his role as Brian O'Conner in Fast and the Furious 7</a>, which is set for a 2014 release date.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapmaWherity6Scq2WYpMC1scNmmqGZop7BunnEr5ynrF2bvLN5z6GgpaGgpbavsdJmq7KomKS8r3nVopqtoZ2oeqOxxaipnmWWlsGiuIyampyhlJq7tXmRaWhsaWFnfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jimmy-buffet-tour-2023-tickets-dates-prices.html><span>←</span><span>Get tickets to his 6 shows in 2023</span></a>
