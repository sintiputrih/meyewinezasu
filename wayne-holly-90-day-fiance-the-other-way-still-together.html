On August 9, 2023 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she posted a video on her Instagram</a> from South Africa.</p><p>Since Wayne lives in <a href=#>South Africa</a> and she has no other known connections to the country, it's assumed that she's still there with him. The reality star also shared <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a video collage</a> of her family back in America on her Instagram.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Holly weeks (@obvious_princess)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Holly captioned the share with the words, "Feeling so sad saying goodbye to my friends and family to go where I have no friends and don't fit in."</p><p>This also suggests that she has taken the leap and has fully moved in with Wayne. Which, does come as a surprise given all of the drama that occurred on-screen.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Their first on-screen interaction between Holly and Wayne didn't go so well.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by 90 Day Fiance (@90dayfiance)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>For most of the <a href=#>couples in Season 5</a>, their first in-person interaction is shown on camera. That isn't the same for Holly and Wayne. She had already come to visit Wayne in South Africa before they started the show.</p><p>Nonetheless, their second meet-up was captured on screen. And it was very uncomfortable to watch. Right upon her arrival, Wayne was not pleased with what she was wearing, and seemed visibly embarrassed by her revealing outfit. His distaste for her clothing became a common discussion between the two all season long.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Safety was a major concern in Holly and Wayne's relationship journey in Season 5.</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>Aside from the clothing disagreement, the main obstacle that seemed to be in Holly and Wayne's way on the show was security. Specifically, Holly had concerns that Wayne's home in South Africa was not safe enough to live in. And she had good reason to.</p><p>At the time of filming, it was revealed that Wayne's home had been broken into on three separate occasions. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">His dog was also unfortunately killed</a> during one of these break-ins. Because of this, Holly tried to start shopping for another home in the area. He didn't approve of giving his home up, and that caused some tension between them.</p><p>Nonetheless, it seems as though the couple has settled their disagreements and are living a happy life together in South Africa. Hopefully, pictures of their wedding will surface on social media soon.</p><p>Season 5 of 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way is available to stream on Discovery+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrK66usRmn6iknK56enyMnZiyZZaerq%2BvxGaroZ1dpMGpsdFmrpqxXajBqrjLZquon5Wptaa%2B</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alex-roe-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-536720-html.html><span>←</span><span>Alex Roe Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
