In its fourth season, the series moved to Netflix and is forever a fan favorite, despite its recent ending. Many of the show’s fans praised it for its ability to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">keep a viewer on edge</a> and make them relive the scenes way after watching.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is The Richest Cast Member Of 'Lucifer' In 2021</a></span></p><p>More interesting than the captivating storyline was the cast, who brought characters to life and earned Lucifer a couple of award nominations, including an Emmy nomination. Given that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the series just wrapped </a>, this is what various members of the cast like to do when they are not making television magic:</p><h2 id=tom-ellis><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Tom Ellis</span></h2><p>Ellis is a proud dad, and occasionally, he shares a few moments with his 10 million followers. Perhaps one of his best parenting moments was when he shared a step-by-step approach his children took towards doing his makeup. Ellis wasn’t particularly fond of the glitter eye shadow, since it took a lot of time to take off afterward. When he’s not trying to get glitter off of his eyes, he’s enjoying a scenic view in his home country, England.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lauren-german><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Lauren German</span></h2><p>Lauren German has nothing but love for her pet dog, who turned three in October of 2020. Every so often, she shares pictures of him. Sometimes, he’s sporting a cool costume like that of a bee or wearing a tiara. Besides wearing matching hats with her dog, German has a love for art and a strong attraction towards anything green. It’s not surprising, therefore, for her to share a picture of beautiful scenery in the countryside or her backyard.</p><h2 id=kevin-alejandro><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Kevin Alejandro</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following the end of Lucifer, it was announced that Alejandro would join the League of Legends voice cast. When he’s not bagging more roles, however, the actor loves to go hiking. While fitness is not particularly a ‘free time’ thing, by virtue of having arms that could bench press a house, Alejandro likes to spend some time at the gym. Just like LaurenGerman, he has an adorable pet, Romeo, who has his own Instagram account.</p><h2 id=d-b-woodside><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>D.B Woodside</span></h2><p>Woodside rarely shares anything online but his work. He, however, is a proud dad and calls his little girl his North Star. Dakota, his girl, celebrated her 12th birthday recently. Woodside has a wonderful pet named Mia, who, sometime in 2020, he said he was ready to give away because of giving him love in a way that only a dog can. We know he was kidding. Who would give away such an adorable dog?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scarlett-estevez><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Scarlett Estevez</span></h2><p>Scarlett Estevez could as well be nicknamed ‘adrenaline girl’ for the most daring zip-lining picture ever. When she zip lines, she goes the extra mile and does it upside down. How insane! It’s also not unusual to spot her taking a picture with one of her pups. She also enjoys a good hike that ends with a beautiful view of the sun setting.</p><h2 id=rachael-harris><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Rachael Harris</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Harris is a proud mommy, who loves to be present for important occasions like birthdays. It’s easy to stumble upon a picture of her children on Instagram. Whether they just got fresh haircuts or are spotting bunny costumes, she’s a super happy mommy. It’s also a not-so-rare sight for her to take a walk in a quiet serene setting. Her go-to shoes are some comfortable sneakers, and while she’s at it, she doesn’t forget to take one picture for the 'gram.</p><h2 id=tricia-helfer><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Tricia Helfer</span></h2><p>On Instagram, Helfer shares ‘parts of my life as I know it,’ and the pieces come together beautifully. Gardening is one of her personal favorites. A truck loaded with dry branches would be what you find somewhere in her house. If not, she’s likely to be seen chilling with her pet cat, Cesar, who makes her feel like a lounge chair sometimes. On a lazy Sunday, Helfer sometimes sports a two-piece bikini while getting a good tan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aimee-garcia><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Aimee Garcia</span></h2><p>In June, only months before the series finale of Lucifer, it was announced that Garcia would be joining the cast of Hulu’s Woke. Outside the craft she’s so passionate about, she’s got some love for the ocean, and it's easy to find her flaunting a bikini pic in the summer. Garcia also cherishes a good time with nature, so a hike within a canopy of trees and a leafy pathway is somewhere high up in her self-care priority list.</p><h2 id=tom-welling><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Tom Welling</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In case you were wondering where Tom Welling would be next after Lucifer, it would help not to wonder anymore, since his series, Professionals, just got acquired by The CW. When he’s not acting, he’s listening to podcasts. Welling also likes himself a good hike with his significant other, and a vacation, preferably in France, just like Beyonce and Jay-Z like to do it.</p><h2 id=inbar-lavi><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Inbar Lavi</span></h2><p>None but Inbar Lavi has more joy this fall since she just tied the knot. It’s as if a season is ending while another just began. When she’s not acting, Lavi indulges in music. She also spends time with her squad ‘frolicking through the woods like psychos' or exploring the ocean. On other days, we’ll find her by the beach with her partner in matching beachwear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>10 Best Instagram Posts From Tom Ellis</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrCiv9NmpJ6lkpq%2FtHnLrpqinpWneqe%2BxJ5kraGdmnqvsdOfo6KwXam8rnnEpaOiq12pvK551p6jpaGenHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./harlow-luna-white-2.html><span>←</span><span>Harlow Luna White Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</span></a>
