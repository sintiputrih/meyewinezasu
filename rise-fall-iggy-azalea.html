In fact, according to <a href=#>MTV News</a>, T.I. even executive produced her star-making freshman album, The New Classic.</p><p>But their blissful professional union hit the skids in September 2015 when the "<a href=#>Live Your Life</a>" rapper started distancing himself from Azalea. During an appearance on&nbsp;Ebro in the Morning (via <a href=#>People</a>), he said their business dealings "took a bit of a rest stop" after the aforementioned tiff between Azalea and Q-Tip. Azalea shot back on Twitter, of course, saying she was completely unaware of any rift between them.</p><p>T.I. then refined his remarks to <a href=#>The Associated Press</a>, saying he was just giving Azalea the space she needed to "come to a place where [she's] ready to come back to the table, so we can start again and make history some more."</p><p>By February 2017, Azalea was downgraded by T.I. all the way to "extended family," when asked about her status on his label. "She's doing as good as Iggy do," he told <a href=#>XXL</a>, adding, "One thing I learned, man, is not to put no time on what she's trying to do. ... I'm not trying to rush her plans to suit mine." Honestly, it's to the point now where T.I. sounds like a dad walking on eggshells to not anger his moody teenage kid, which can't possibly bode well for other potential Azalea collaborators.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma21pa3yztdKeZJ%2BZnKF6qrPGsmSaspGhsqJ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./famous-july-birthdays.html><span>←</span><span>Famous July Birthdays 90+ Celebrities Born in July</span></a>
