As we gear up for the next installment in the lives of our favorite summer families, it becomes clear that Jenny Han will likely follow a major plot point from the second book, pushing forward a storyline we’re not yet prepared to see, but one that will be necessary for driving things forward.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Lola⚡️ (@lola.tung)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=458 data-current-count=758 data-injectable=true>If you’ve not yet read the books, we’re not giving anything away here, but from some of the first-look images released today from The Summer I Turned Pretty and Elle, one can piece together a turning point in the lives of these characters that draws some of them closer while pushing others apart.
