During her first Eras Tour show in Tokyo on Feb. 7, Swift told the crowd that she wasn't certain about announcing her upcoming album, The Tortured Poet's Department, during the 2024 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Grammy Awards</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I had this plan in my head, and I told my friends — I told Jack [Antonoff], but I hadn’t really told many other people,"&nbsp;she can be seen saying in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>video taken by a concertgoer</a>. Of course, the singer-songwriter wasn't 100% sure she would win any trophies on Sunday.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I thought, 'OK, so if I’m lucky enough to win one thing tonight, I’m just going to do it. I’m just going to announce my new album,'" she explained to the cheering audience. "I told myself if I'm lucky enough to win anything tonight, I'm just gonna do it. I'm just gonna announce it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She went on to say that if that plan didn't exactly pan out, then she would have made the big reveal during one of the Tokyo shows. "My backup plan was that I was gonna announce tonight in Tokyo!"</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Elsewhere during the set, Swift opened up about the writing process of the new album. She revealed that she started writing it immediately after "turning in" her album Midnights, so it's been in the works for about two years.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I’ve been working on it for about two years, I kept working on it throughout the U.S. tour," she said. "When it was prefect in my opinion — when it was good enough for you — I finished it. I am so, so excited. Soon, you'll get to hear it. Soon, we’ll get to hear it together."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The timing of the process means she was still with her ex Joe Alwyn when she began working on the album. The bonus track on Midnights titled "You're Losing Me" is widely believed to be about the demise of her and Alwyn's relationship. Antonoff revealed that the record was written in 2021, aligning with the work from the upcoming album and further fueling <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>theories</a> that it's about Taylor and Joe's breakup.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the end of the day, Swift ultimately makes new music for herself.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Everyone asks, 'Why do you make so many albums?' It's like, 'Man, because I love it so much. I'm having fun," she added. "Leave me alone.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK5705qwpaeiYsC4tcWtZKedp2Kura7UpmSapp6kwq%2BvxKacp6xdqbysxc5mqqGnp2KFdoKScmxr</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./singer-of-the-1973-pop-song-piano-man-which-sounds-like-a-waltz-2-wds-html.html><span>←</span><span>Singer of the 1973 pop song Piano Man which sounds like a waltz: 2 wds.</span></a>
