The two lovebirds have been married for more than a decade and are still going strong as we speak.</p><h2><span id=Jessica_Seanoa_Early_life_age_education>Jessica Seanoa | Early life, age, education</span></h2><p>Wife of Samoa Joe, Jessica was born in the city of the United States of America. Seanoa is a U.S. resident, though her race is white.But something other than this knowledge is uncertain. Coming from a non-famous background, Jessica didn’t have anything to tell about her early life and family.</p><p>Likewise, the name and whereabouts of her parents and relatives are unheard of. Not to mention, even the exact date of birth is difficult to ascertain. However, according to some sources, she’s in the mid-30s.</p><p>Even her academics and educational history are untraceable at this stage. But we’re going to make sure that we update after we get some details about it.</p><h2><span id=A_little_bit_about_Samoa_Joe-Is_he_really_a_Samoan>A little bit about Samoa Joe-Is he really a Samoan?</span></h2><p>Nuufolau Joel Seanoa, also known as Samoa Joe, is a professional wrestler who has been signed to WWE. Right now, he’s performing on the Raw brand.Formed on March 17, 1979, Joe was originally from Orange County, California, and later grew up in Ewa Beach, Hawaii. Samoa was trained as an athlete from a younger age, and his physics suited him well to be a Judo player.</p><h2><span id=Samoa_Joe_is_a_survivor_of_the_World_War>Samoa Joe is a survivor of the World War.</span></h2><p>Before making it big in the WWE, Samoa began a wrestling trip from Japan to fight in a series of pay-per-view tournaments, including annual Burning Heart tournaments.</p><p>After a year in Japan, Joe eventually returned to the states in 2002 and began to market himself as a wrestler. Initially, he made his debut at “Glory by Honor” as Christopher Daniel’s “hired assassin.” In addition, Joe rapidly rose through the ranks and became the ROH (Ring Of Honor) champion.</p><h2><span id=World_Championship>World Championship</span></h2><p>On May 20, 2015, Joe made his debut at NXT TakeOver Unstoppable as a face. Owing to its fantastic fan base and merchandise sales, WWE agreed to sign it as a full-time contract. After that, he made his debut on June 10, beating Scott Dawson.</p><p>And after that, Joe made a huge impact with his new fans and has been one of the favorites in the show ever since. Already a veteran, Joe uses his blissful, MMA-inspired offense to rack up titles, including top promotions across the globe.</p><p>He also captured the WWE NXT title twice and faced rivals including AJ Styles, Roman Reigns, and Brock Lesnar in his SmackDown LIVE shows. Title or not, this current champion is the most dangerous challenge to anyone in the World War II universe.</p><h2><span id=Jessica_Seanoa_Life_as_a_wrestler8217s_wife_a_husband_and_a_personal_life>Jessica Seanoa | Life as a wrestler’s wife: a husband and a personal life</span></h2><p>The only thing we’ve got clear proof of about Jessica is her friendship with WWE wrestler Samoa Joe. Yeah, the popular wife only came to the spotlight after her relationship with the superstar got out in public.</p><p>Talking about her personal life with Joe, she’s very private again. And we don’t know how long they’ve been dated or the exact time and date. As for their first meeting, they first met when Samoa was TNA World Champion.</p><p>We know, however, that the two have been dating for a long time, and only then have they advanced to the next step. On July 27, 2007, Samoa and Jessica exchanged their vows in the presence of their families and loved ones.</p><p>Now, 17 years, 2020, the two are still as good as a couple. But to this date, they don’t have a boy. And by the look of it, Jessica doesn’t even have a plan to have one soon.</p><p>Aside from that, Jessica has maintained secrecy from the media and has not made any of her information public. Unlike other celebrity wives, Seanoa barely assists her husband in public functions and red carpet events.</p><h2><span id=Jessica_Seanoa_Net_Worth_and_Income_How_much_is_Samoa_Joes_net_worth>Jessica Seanoa | Net Worth and Income: How much is Samoa Joe’s net worth?</span></h2><p>Since Jessica’s professional life is under the rock like her personal life, we cannot, for sure, assume her net worth as well. But being the wife of a WWE superstar, there is no way she is living a thrifty life.</p><p>According to recent reports, Samoa Joe has an estimated net worth of $4 million. Also, from his successful career, he earns $80,000 every year from his venture in WWE alone.</p><p>Despite having a grueling match and sometimes even bloodied, WWE wrestlers are known to live a luxurious lifestyle. Risk aside, the perks of being in a dangerous industry is obviously the handsome pay.</p><p>Likewise, at the moment, it seems Jessica is enjoying the wealth of her husband and living a comfortable life. The couple is spotted in various places, traveling, and having a fantastic vacation.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table style="width:80%;margin:0 auto" class=mytable width=100%><tbody><tr style=height:21px><td style=height:21px><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td style=height:21px>Jessica Seanoa</td></tr><tr style=height:21px><td style=height:21px><strong>Birth Date</strong></td><td style=height:21px>The 1990s</td></tr><tr style=height:21px><td style=height:21px><strong>Birth Place</strong></td><td style=height:21px>The United States of America</td></tr><tr style=height:21px><td style=height:21px><strong>Known as&nbsp;</strong></td><td style=height:21px>Wife of WWE superstar Samoa joe</td></tr><tr style=height:21px><td style=height:21px><strong>Religion</strong></td><td style=height:21px>Unknown</td></tr><tr style=height:21px><td style=height:21px><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td style=height:21px>American</td></tr><tr style=height:21px><td style=height:21px><strong>Ethnicity</strong></td><td style=height:21px>White</td></tr><tr style=height:21px><td style=height:21px><strong>University</strong></td><td style=height:21px>Updating Soon</td></tr><tr style=height:21px><td style=height:21px><strong>School</strong></td><td style=height:21px>Updating Soon</td></tr><tr style=height:21px><td style=height:21px><strong>Horoscope</strong></td><td style=height:21px>Not Available</td></tr><tr style=height:21px><td style=height:21px><strong>Father’s Name</strong></td><td style=height:21px>Not Available</td></tr><tr style=height:21px><td style=height:21px><strong>Mother’s Name&nbsp;</strong></td><td style=height:21px>Not Available</td></tr><tr style=height:21px><td style=height:21px><strong>Siblings&nbsp;</strong></td><td style=height:21px>Not Available</td></tr><tr style=height:21px><td style=height:21px><strong>Age</strong></td><td style=height:21px>The Mid-30s</td></tr><tr style=height:21px><td style=height:21px><strong>Height</strong></td><td style=height:21px>Updating soon</td></tr><tr style=height:21px><td style=height:21px><strong>Weight</strong></td><td style=height:21px>Updating Soon</td></tr><tr style=height:21px><td style=height:21px><strong>Build</strong></td><td style=height:21px>Slender</td></tr><tr style=height:21px><td style=height:21px><strong>Eye color</strong></td><td style=height:21px>Hazel</td></tr><tr style=height:21px><td style=height:21px><strong>Hair color</strong></td><td style=height:21px>Blonde</td></tr><tr style=height:21px><td style=height:21px><strong>Profession</strong></td><td style=height:21px>Unknown</td></tr><tr style=height:21px><td style=height:21px><strong>Marital Status</strong></td><td style=height:21px>Married</td></tr><tr style=height:21px><td style=height:21px><strong>Husband&nbsp;</strong></td><td style=height:21px><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal>Samoa Joe</a></td></tr><tr style=height:21px><td style=height:21px><strong>Wedding Anniversary&nbsp;</strong></td><td style=height:21px>July 27, 2007</td></tr><tr style=height:21px><td style=height:21px><strong>Children&nbsp;</strong></td><td style=height:21px>None</td></tr><tr style=height:21px><td style=height:21px><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td style=height:21px>Under Review</td></tr><tr style=height:21px><td style=height:21px><strong>Merch of Samoa Joe</strong></td><td style=height:21px><a href=# rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Toys</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Trading Cards</a></td></tr></tbody></table><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>David Mkhonto</a></h3>David Mkhonto estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
