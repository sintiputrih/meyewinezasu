The movie has fulfilled a longtime dream for the school friends.</p><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=597 data-injectable=true>“I listened to techno,” said Byrne. “Hip hop, too!” Boylan added. “But Krew has a very long dance background,” continued Byrne. “She was part of a youth dance company for years in Australia and danced since she was a little girl, so music has always been her first love.”</p><p data-characters=614 data-current-count=614 data-injectable=true>The Australian film follows Raylene “Red” Delaney (Boylan), who isn’t cut out for the 9-to-5 life and prefers to hide her ginger curls (or as she calls them, “clown hair”) with a blonde wig and slip into the character of her idol, Dolly Parton. After a very justified firing from her role as a real estate appraiser, Red rethinks a chance encounter she had while dressed as Dolly with celebrity impersonator manager Teeth (Celeste Barber), and tries out for a spot on the roster. From there, she dives into her own Alice in Wonderland story, if the Chesire Cat had a suitcase of wigs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/the-cow.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/seriously-red-224795-scaled.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/the-lost-city.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/the-unbearable-weight-of-massive-talent-229253-e1678821504206.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/the-voice-actress-1.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/the-unknown-country.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/emergency.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/It-Is-In-Us-All-Cosmo-Jarvis-as-Hamish-1200x675-1.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/to-leslie.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/deadstream.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-225111.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/the-blind-man-who-did-not-want-to-see-titanic-217594.jpeg><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=444 data-injectable=true>Raylene, Raylene, Raylene, Raaaayleeen’s world is saturated in teal, mustard, and, yes, red. She lives in her mom’s garage apartment, an arrangement that doesn’t work for either of them. “A beautiful sunburned mushroom” is what counts for a compliment in their home. Red’s garage bedroom looks like a Dolly Parton-themed 60s tiki bar, but she makes a point to tell a client how back in time his own house is.</p><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=320 data-injectable=false>To put it mildly, Red and her Dolly impersonation are not in their final form, and she quickly gets to work upgrading her wig and rehearsing in front of the mirror. However, in her personal life, it’s all taking and no giving a little longer. That’s intentional. Boylan wanted Red’s journey to be big.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>The screenwriter notes that it took the world time to catch up with Dolly. “I get the sense that Dolly has had those experiences as well, especially her choosing to express herself the way she does,” said Boylan. “She got a lot of flack in the early days.”</p><p data-characters=158 data-current-count=158 data-injectable=false>Once Red’s quest to be herself on purpose lands her in the local impersonator scene, her world opens up, traveling as far as Hong Kong portraying Dolly.</p><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=464 data-injectable=true>Immediately, she’s a magnet for her peers that also seem to have lost their sense of self in the game. Byrne plays the local Elvis, a notorious heartbreaker in the impersonator scene. Red, against all advice, becomes entangled with The King, who, in turn, disappears into the shadows as they please.</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>“Now on the screen, I feel like Elvis has kind of evolved to be a nonbinary character that I feel is very representative of the movie, says Byrne. “And it’s very jarring when, when they break character and address Dolly.”</p><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true>Bobby Cannavale brought Neil Diamond into the mix as a retired performer-turned-power player in the impersonator industry who offers hard-earned advice to the optimistic-by-necessity newcomer. Apparently, Cannavale is a big fan, and the part was rewritten per his input.</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>“He offered it up like, ‘Yeah, if this was Neil Diamond…’ and I didn’t know that much about Neil Diamond, and I’m sorry to say,” says Boylan. “But once he said that, I was like [gasps] and went back and really fell in love with Neil Diamond and rewrote it, hoping that he would say yes to it.”</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true>And of course, Raylene’s Dolly fell for her own Kenny Rogers, a man who stays in character at all times and demands she does the same. When Raylene is looking for real intimacy, he will not break character. The role eventually went to Daniel Webster, who Boylan got to know during an acting Masterclass.</p><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=279 data-injectable=false>“It was a tricky, it was a tricky part to cast the Kenny Rogers part,” says Boylan. “But we wanted someone who had charisma, who had the musical chops, who you believe and who could dig deep in getting into character like that and also not play the lead.”</p><p data-characters=439 data-current-count=718 data-injectable=true>The cast is filled out with plenty of authentic impersonators, too. Australian treasure Kylie Minogue is represented, of course, and the bars are full of anachronistic A-list couplings. “Bad Romance” -era Lady Gaga might dine with the Who’s Afraid of Virginia Wolf? Elizabeth Taylor, and it couldn’t feel more right in the cocoon of the night. Seriously Red leaves you wondering who they all are when they go home.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8SxmqWto57DpnnRqKqeZZKuv6%2BxjJqlnWWbp7K4ecGosKWZnmKxqr%2FCrqqsZaSdsqq%2BjKecsGWWnrmuecCbpq6sXZZ6pbvLpbBmqJGnwbC6jKKkqZ2iqLyvrdOoqWarlae2sMHSpbBmqpWZfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bachelors-emily-ferguson-engaged-to-hockey-player-william-karlsson.html><span>←</span><span>Bachelors Emily Ferguson Engaged to Hockey Player William Karlsson</span></a>
