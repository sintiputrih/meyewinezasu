Let’s shed some light on Roiland’s net worth, particularly his earnings from Rick and Morty.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-justin-roiland-net-worth-from-rick-and-morty-and-more data-injectable=false><strong>Justin Roiland: Net worth from Rick and Morty and more</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-888461318.jpg><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false>It is true that Rick and Morty put Roiland on the map, and being the show’s executive producer as well as the voice of the protagonists, Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith, he has managed to accumulate quite a lot of wealth.</p><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=610 data-injectable=true>The show ran for six seasons starting in 2013 and has aired a total of 61 episodes to date. Before the success of the Adult Swim series, Roiland was engaged in quite a lot of other projects, which garnered him recognition and decent earnings. After graduating from college, he began his career as an actor and starred in the movie Yacht Rock and the comedy series, 2 Girls, 1 Cup: The Show.</p><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=366 data-injectable=false>He also appeared in The Sarah Silverman Program, from which <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he earned around $15,000</a>.

Combining his earnings from all the projects, his current net worth stands at $4 million.</p><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=765 data-injectable=true>It is most likely that the major chunk of the income was garnered from Rick and Morty where he served as the executive producer as well as a voice actor. Following his exit from the show, which is awaiting the release of its upcoming season later this year, there are questions regarding whether <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he would be receiving royalties</a> from the subsequent seasons of the show, given his role as the creator.</p><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=244 data-injectable=false>However, it is uncertain if Adult Swim and Roiland signed any contract. Also if there’s been any discussion regarding the same, then the amount that he would possibly be receiving is unknown as the show’s budget hasn’t been disclosed yet.</p><p data-characters=145 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false>As Rick and Morty approaches its seventh season, it would be exciting to see who would take over the leading voice roles and how they would fare.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S3tr%2FToqVmqp%2BeuaK6w6xkp52kYsSwvtOhZJ6woKGuqrrEnWShp6diuravx2apqKGclrulecyam55llqe8rnnRopqkZZGjsW65zqursmWRo7Fuuc6rnGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-dalys-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>John DalyS Net Worth 2024</span></a>
