Farrow,&nbsp;which focused&nbsp;on allegations of abuse in&nbsp;Allen's family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=allegations-of-sexual-assault>Allegations of Sexual Assault</h2><p>At the center of all this&nbsp;has been 35-year old Dylan Farrow, the daughter of Woody and his ex-partner Mia Farrow, who&nbsp;maintains that he&nbsp;sexually assaulted her when she was seven years old.</p><p>Dylan was adopted by Mia in 1985 when she was only two weeks old and the actress was in a relationship with Woody. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by Esquire</a>, Woody then decided that he wanted to play a larger role in Dylan's life and asked Mia if he could co-adopt her. Despite some reservations, Mia agreed to the suggestion and in 1991, Woody officially became Dylan's adoptive father.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Are Dustin Hoffman's 6 Kids, And What Do They Do?</a></span></p><p>By this time, it had started to become apparent to Mia and the people around Woody that he was growing extremely close to Dylan, in ways that were bordering on inappropriate. Although the actor was quick to denounce any suggestions of impropriety on his part, he eventually agreed to&nbsp;seek help from a psychologist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not too long after this, Mia became aware of a romantic relationship budding between Woody and Soon-Yi Previn, another of her adopted daughters. Soon-Yi, adopted in a previous marriage between Mia and musician André Previn, was 21&nbsp;at the time.</p><p>As the relationship between Woody and Mia grew more strained, the allegations by Dylan against Woody first hit the national news in August 1992. The combination of&nbsp;Mia's prior discovery and the sexual abuse&nbsp;allegations brought an end to the relationship between Woody and Mia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Woody-Allen-and-Mia-Farrow.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Soon-Yi&nbsp;made a statement to Newsweek</a>, defending her relationship with Woody as totally appropriate, a stance she has maintained to date. "When I first got friendly with Woody, he and Mia were finished with their romance and were just friends,"&nbsp;she said. "I think Mia would have been just as angry if he had taken up with another actress or his secretary."</p><p>Soon-Yi and Woody eventually got married in 1997, aided legally by the fact that&nbsp;he had never&nbsp;adopted her, nor officially&nbsp;gotten married to&nbsp;Mia.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim & Kanye And 9 Other Celebrity Couple Breakups So Far In 2021</a></span></p><h2 id=first-public-interview>First Public Interview</h2><p>In 2013, at the age of 28, Dylan did her first-ever public interview on the saga. In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tell-all interview by Maureen Orth of Vanity Fair</a> with Mia and eight of her kids, Dylan expressed how&nbsp;Woody's alleged actions had made her feel as a child. "For all I knew, this was how fathers treated their daughters." Dylan explained. "This was normal interaction, and I was not normal for feeling uncomfortable about it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From Dylan's perspective, not much that could be done to grant her justice, given her allegations&nbsp;had been investigated by a Connecticut prosecutor who decided not to charge Allen.</p><p>Now 85,&nbsp;Woody had&nbsp;Apropos Of Nothing,&nbsp;a memoir about his life published in March 2020, despite <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">having been dropped by a previous publisher</a>.</p><p>Dylan has also gone on to become a professional writer in her own right. In October 2020, she had her first novel,&nbsp;Hush&nbsp;published by St. Martin's Press. In Allen v. Farrow,&nbsp;she also revealed the identity of her husband, Sean for the first time. They have been married since 2011 and live in Connecticut.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">An Inside Look At Jamie Foxx's Relationship With His Daughter, Corinne</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuw86om7JlkaG5prrSZpuarZedwaa%2BjJ2wpZmeYrOivtGormaZnpl6uLTArWSdp5WoerS0xGabqGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-untold-truth-of-alaska-the-last-frontier-star-atz-kilcher-542018-html.html><span>←</span><span>The Untold Truth Of Alaska: The Last Frontier Star Atz Kilcher</span></a>
