And I feel so adult.”</p><p>She added: “It’s such a good excuse. ‘You know I gotta check with my husband.’ And everyone is like, ‘Oh, OK.’ It sounds so official.”</p><p>Their date nights usually involve “doing nothing, which is the best thing ever.” The singer told Us, “I feel like our lives are so busy that when we get to cuddle on the couch and make some dinner together, that is our perfect date night. But we love to travel, we’re very adventurous so we kind of flow wherever it takes us.&nbsp;I think that’s part of what makes us work.”</p><p><a href=#>Pieterse announced her engagement</a> via Instagram in December 2015 with romantic proposal photographs captioned, “The best day of my life.
