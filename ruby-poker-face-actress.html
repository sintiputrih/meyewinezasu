Ruby now works in a Home Depot-like store, but every year, she and the band attempt to reclaim their near-fame. They’ve gotten so desperate for their bigger break (they’re a one-hit wonder thanks to their song, “Staplehead”) that they’d even go as far as murder.</p><p>So who is the actress behind Ruby in <a href=#>Peacock’s</a> Poker Face?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The actress who plays Ruby in ‘Poker Face’ is none other than Chloë Sevigny.</h2><p>Who else could play Ruby but the effervescent <a href=#>Chloë Sevigny</a>? Not only is she real-life besties with Natasha Lyonne, but Poker Face also isn’t her first rodeo in playing a supposed killer. In 2019, Chloë starred opposite <a href=#>Kristen Stewart</a> in Lizzie as Lizzie Borden, one of the most infamous murderers of all-time. Now, Chloë is playing Ruby, who could become infamous for murder in the world of Poker Face, which represents the irony of searching for fame.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While many of us may recognize Chloë from her 1999 Academy Award-nominated performance as Lana Tisdel in Boys Don’t Cry, or her Golden Globe-winning performance as Nicolette Grant in Big Love, she’s had several other recognizable roles throughout her almost 30-year acting career. An <a href=#>American Horror Story</a> and Bloodline regular, Chloë is adept in both television and movies.</p><p>One of Chloë’s more recent roles was opposite Natasha in <a href=#>Season 2 of Russian Doll</a> as Lenora, aka Nadia’s mother. Natasha spoke with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> while promoting the Netflix series, and revealed that the two of them are “like sisters.” Chloë also shared, “We've been kind of having this working friendship, you know, for many years now … [Natasha is] the first person I call when I get an offer to talk to her about the material about the other people involved."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Naturally, with all of Poker Face’s guest stars, we can’t be too surprised that acclaimed actor Chloë is one of them. Some other notable stars to look forward to, however, are <a href=#>Judith Light</a>, Tim Meadows, Rhea Perlman, Clea DuVall, and many more.</p><p>New episodes of Poker Face drop every Thursday on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp8KjxYyppqSdomKzoq%2FEZpicrKKawLQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./saad-lamjarred.html><span>←</span><span>Saad Lamjarred Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki 2024</span></a>
