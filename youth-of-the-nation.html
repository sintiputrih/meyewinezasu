IT STATES CLEARLY THAT THE KID WHO DID THE SHOOTING WAS INVISIBLE - BY EVERYONE. AND THE WAY THE KID GOT ATTENTION ENDED IN TRAGEDY.</p><p>"She might act kind of proud with no respect for herself<br>She finds love in all the wrong places<br>The same situations just different faces<br>Changed up her pace since her daddy left her<br>Too bad he never told she deserved much better"</p><p>EVER HERE THE SAYING "A GIRL LOOKS FOR A MAN LIKE HER FATHER". NO MATTER WHAT - A FATHER'S ROLE IN HIS DAUGHTER'S LIFE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ROLE - HE HELPS SHAPE WHAT SHE LOOKS FOR IN A MAN. IF HE IS ABSENT, SHE LOOKS "LOVE IN ALL THE WRONG PLACES", HE ISN'T THERE TO TEACH HER RESPECT FOR HERSELF AND WHAT SHE SHOULD GET FROM A MAN.</p><p>Johnny boy always played the fool<br>He broke all the rules so you would think he was cool<br>He was never really one of the guys no matter how hard he tried<br>Often thought of suicide<br>Its kind of hard when you aint got no friends<br>He put his life to an end they might remember him then<br>You cross the line and there's no turning back<br>Told the world how he felt with the sound of a gat"</p><p>KIDS THESE DAYS ARE CRUEL TO ONE ANOTHER. THEY BELITTLE OTHERS TO THE POINT THAT THAT KID FEELS LIKE THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO DO - BUT TO KILL THEMSELVES - THEN PEOPLE "MIGHT REMEMBER HIM THEN".</p><p>"We are we are, the youth of the nation<br>We are we are, youth of the nation<br>We are we are, the youth of the nation<br>We are we are, youth of the nation</p><p>Whos to blame for the life that tradgedies claim<br>No matter what you say it don't take away the pain that I feel inside<br>Im tired of all the lies<br>Don't nobody know why<br>Its the blind leading the blind"</p><p>THIS IS THE COURSE AND LAST VERSE - THE STRONGEST OF THE ENTIRE SONG. IN THE ABOVE 3 VERSES THE WRITER WROTE ABOUT TRUE THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON WITH THE YOUTH OF TODAY. SOCIETY HAS MOLDED WHAT WE SHOULD THINK IS "COOL" AND "UNCOOL". LISTEN TO THE SONG, AND LET THE COURSE RUN TOGETHER, DON'T LISTEN TO THE WORDS AS SINGLE WORDS, LISTEN TO IT AS "YOUTHOFANATION"...IT SOUNDS LIKE "EUTHANASIA"...WHICH IS ANOTHER WORD FOR ASSISTED SUICIDE. AS A NATION WE HELP THE PROBLEMS ARISE WITH OUR YOUTH. WE AS A NATION ARE KILLING OUR YOUTH.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rcXRopqipqSav7G%2BxK2YraGfo8Bvr86mZqmnlGTGsMHToWSonl2ptaZ5zZqroqee</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rihanna-sells-out-9000-dollar-dolce-gabanna-headphones.html><span>←</span><span>Rihanna Sells Out $9000 Dolce &amp;amp; Gabanna Headphones</span></a>
