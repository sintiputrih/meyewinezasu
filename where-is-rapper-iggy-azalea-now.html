When the aspiring singer turned 16, she moved to the United States in search of a career in the American music industry.</p><p>In 2011, the “Trouble” singer went viral on YouTube when she uploaded a music video for her original song “Pu$$y.” The video caught the attention of T.I., who signed the young rapper to his Grand Hustle Records label.</p><p>Azalea’s debut album,&nbsp;The New Classic,&nbsp;dropped in 2014, making her a household name. Fans couldn’t get enough of chart-topping hits that included “Work,” “Fancy,” and the single “Black Widow” featuring Rita Ora. That same year, Azalea appeared on the single “Problem” with <a href=#>Ariana Grande</a>.</p><p>In 2018, Azalea switched labels and released the EP&nbsp;Survive the Summer,&nbsp;followed by her second studio album,&nbsp;In My Defense,&nbsp;released in 2019.&nbsp;The “<a href=#>Sally Walker</a>” performer released another EP,&nbsp;Wicked Lips,&nbsp;and then put out&nbsp;The End of an Era,&nbsp;her third and final studio album, before announcing her hiatus from music in the summer of 2021.</p><p>In the past decade, Azalea has received four Grammy nominations and won various prestigious awards, including American Music, MTV, and Billboard Music.&nbsp;The hit single, “Go Hard or Go Home,” was featured on the soundtrack of the&nbsp;<a href=#>Fast & Furious 7</a>&nbsp;film. The award-winning artist has collaborated with Jennifer Hudson, Wiz Khalifa, Bebe Rexha, Tyga, Britney Spears, Charli XCX, and more.</p><p>The rapper’s YouTube channel has over 3.4 billion views, and to date, she has sold 48 million records worldwide. As of 2021, Azalea’s estimated <a href=#>net worth</a> was $15 million.</p><h2 id=h-taking-a-break-from-the-music-industry>Taking a break from the music industry</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>“End of an Era” is so special to me because after I drop my album next month iam going to take a few years to focus on other creative projects and things I’m feeling passionate and inspired by, beyond music.<br>I’m excited for you guys to see different sides to me in the future.</p><p>— IGGY AZALEA (@IGGYAZALEA) <a rel=noopener href=#>July 15, 2021</a></p></figure><p>Despite a highly-successful career, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">USA Today</a> reported Azalea has been controversial since her first days in the U.S. spotlight.</p><p>Racist comments seemed to plague the white female rapper, often accused of cultural appropriation and blackfishing. High-profile celebrities such as <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>, <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a>, and <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a> have also been called out for changing their appearances to look like someone of Black/African descent. In addition to using makeup and hairstyles to alter her looks, Azalea uses an exaggerated Southern drawl while rapping that many refer to as a “blaccent.”</p><p>According to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Beast</a>, Azalea was <a href=#>unapologetic about her behavior</a>, saying in a 2019 Cosmopolitan interview, “I’m still going to make the same type of music and still be ridiculous and larger than life.” She continued, “So, I can’t be that f**king sorry about it.”</p><p>The 31-year-old artist has also had her share of celebrity beef with fellow rappers <a href=#>Snoop Dogg</a>, Azealia Banks, <a href=#>Lizzo</a>, Macklemore, and <a href=#>Eminem</a>. She notoriously <a href=#>threw shade at Cardi B</a> and Megan Thee Stallion in a Tweet that went viral and was involved in a <a href=#>highly publicized feud</a> with former mentor T.I. after he referred to her as a “problematic rapper.” According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Root</a>, the recording mogul said, “I’m still actively looking for another female rapper who can undo the blunder of Iggy Azalea.”</p><p>Tired of the drama and looking for a change, Azalea announced via Twitter in July 2021 that she was “going to take a few years to focus on other creative projects and things I’m feeling passionate and inspired by, beyond music.”&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-is-the-hiatus-over>Is the hiatus over?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>In May 2020, Azalea gave birth to a son, Onyx, who she shares with rapper <a href=#>Playboi Carti</a>. Many fans believed her decision to put her music career on hold centered around being a mom.</p><p>After making the announcement, Azalea told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Tonight</a> that she had no intention of signing any new offers and was not contractually obligated to do so. She admitted she does not want to do “an aggressive tour where you’re away all the time.” Azalea said, “I don’t want my son to be transient in that way, always on a tour bus… that’s not my vision for my future.”</p><p>The rapper’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram feed</a> offers an inkling of what she has been up to lately. She promotes her Totally Plastic makeup line carried in Ulta stores, reminisces about past tours, eats ice cream in a hot tub, and enjoys riding a bike. Azalea’s latest Instagram post shows her with a horse, with the caption, “First day back riding in 3 years!”</p><p>Now, less than a year later, it seems Azalea may have had a change of heart. The pop-culture phenom recently performed in Las Vegas and is headlining the European EXIT festival in Serbia in July 2022. She is also embarking on a 25 concert U.S. summer tour with Pitbull. The “Can’t Stop Us Now” tour begins in Raleigh, North Carolina, on July 28, 2022.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp; <a href=#>What Do Iggy Azalea and The Beatles Have in Common?</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOsJ%2BeqpVitrR50ZqnqZ2iYraos9hmmLOZnJqubrrOsGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./drake-cheers-on-serena-williams-at-wimbledon.html><span>←</span><span>Drake Cheers on Serena Williams at Wimbledon</span></a>
