In the clip, McIntyre recounted stumbling upon the comedian's YouTube channel in her early years and subsequently creating social media fan pages to support her art. "After 2016 during a live stream that I will discuss later, me and Colleen started talking on a more personal level. By 2017, we were good friends or what I would have called good friends," he added. As their friendship progressed, Ballinger, then 30 years old, reportedly started getting inappropriate with McIntyre, who was only 13 at the time. In the clip, McIntyre says he soon began receiving unsolicited information from Ballinger regarding her divorce and relationship with her ex-husband. With time, things got even weirder, with Ballinger once sending McIntyre lingerie and constantly bringing up sexual conversations.</p><p>Though his allegations initially didn't gain as much ground, McIntyre's 2020 video recently resurfaced after&nbsp;KodeeRants, another YouTube content creator, alleged that Ballinger often made suggestive comments to members of her fandom who belonged to a group chat called Colleeny's Weenies. According to <a href=#>NBC News</a>, the video, which has since been deleted, featured screenshots of Ballinger asking the group for their favorite position and McIntyre of his virginity status.&nbsp;Johnny Silvestri, another Ballinger super fan, also recounted his friendship with the comedian, which according to <a href=#>HuffPost</a>, was characterized by trauma dumping on him and other minors in her fandom.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtibIB6g46cpqWklZq7bq7ApaOippeav26wyKyrrqqUpLqitc2Ybmabn6PBs7vVnqmssV2axbG4wKKlnpxf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nick-davis-weinstein.html><span>←</span><span>Nick Davis Weinstein - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Facts</span></a>
