In the reunion, it looked like I was talking about a new relationship and here’s Jason hurting,” Stause said on the new episodes, which started streaming in May. “He had been with many people that he didn’t care to call the next day, you know, Alyssa with three S’s just left at 6 a.m. It’s not fair.”</p><p>Nurk, meanwhile, appeared throughout the season — and <a href=#>slighted Stause by leaving her out</a> when asked about the agents via social media.</p><p>“I really love some of the cast members,” Nurk said via Instagram before referencing <a href=#><strong>Mary Fitzgerald</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Amanza Smith</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Chelsea Lazkani</strong></a> and season 6 newbie <a href=#><strong>Nicole Young</strong></a>. “Mary, for example, is so sweet. Amanza is funny and smart. Chelsea’s also so smart and so funny. I love them. Nicole has the biggest heart. She’s a really good friend of mine. The rest is … OK.
