Jane was a tough tomboy who had a big family, while Maura was prime and proper, and together they made sense.</p><p>“Angie and I are very different people. We’re raised different. In real life we’re very different, but the chemistry just works,” the <a href=#>NCIS</a> alum explained. “I feel like we represent different types of women and we can celebrate all of that without it trying to be one or the other.”</p><p>The connection seen between the show’s stars on TV stretched to the rest of the cast, which was partially made up of Jane’s family members — brothers police officer Frankie Rizzoli Jr. (<strong>Jordan Bridges</strong>) and Tommy Rizzoli (<a href=#><strong>Colin Egglesfield</strong></a>) and their “ma,” Angela (<strong>Lorraine Bracco</strong>).</p><p>The crime-solving duo’s coworkers were rounded out by detective Vince Korsak (<strong>Bruce McGill</strong>), detective Barry Frost (Lee Thompson Young) and lab tech Nina Holiday (<strong>Idara Victor</strong>).</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Tragedy stuck the Rizzoli & Isles family in August 2013, when <a href=#>Lee Thompson Young died by suicide</a> at the age of 29. The loss was felt throughout the cast and crew, which is what led to them <a href=#>honoring him in the season 5 premiere</a>.</p><p>“We had one simple principle, which was to make sure that <a href=#>we were honoring Lee</a> and the character of Barry Frost,” showrunner <strong>Jan Nash</strong> told <a href=#>Slate</a> in June 2014. “If the people who loved Lee chose to see it, they would feel that we were honoring his memory.”</p><p>Scroll down to see what the cast of the TNT drama have been up to since its 2016 end.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BntrvGzqWgZqGjobK0ecKaqq1lp52ys7GMmqmeZaSdsrp5zaiuaKSfp7%2Bitc2eZJuqkZiwsHmSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./evga-geforce-gtx-680-classified-review.html><span>←</span><span>Meet The EVGA GeForce GTX 680 Classified</span></a>
