"Y'all were so smooth with it," John Legend told the duo.</p><p>"Jason, I really love the gentleness of your tone... I think I would side just slightly with Eli," John stated.</p><p>Reba supported Eli.</p><p>"Eli, I love your fifties meets seventies kinda smoothness," Niall Horan said, adding, "There's a real smoothness to your voice."</p><p>After implying that it was difficult for Niall to choose, he stated that he will support Jason.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/b1659e75-40f8-482a-924f-9663729c265f.png><h2 class=split>Who did Gwen Stefani pick for 'The Voice' Season 24 Knockouts?</h2><p>"Eli your's just shocked me...you have a really warm chest voice," she murmured, adding, "I think I'll have to go with the person who is really more ready."</p><p>She chose Jason to advance in the competition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/85d0166e-9805-4013-bc80-c9b2c4712afe.png><h2 class=split>Who is Jason Arcilla on 'The Voice' Season 24?</h2><p>When Jason was 9 months old, his parents moved to the United States from the Philippines in search of a better life for their family.</p><p>Jason began making his own music when he was 14 and liked it, but he had to put it on hold as he and his high school sweetheart became parents to their daughter Oshynn when he was 17.</p><p>It was exceedingly tough for him to be a teen dad, and he battled to get his music off the ground. Jason gained full custody of Oshynn when she was five years old and moved him home with his parents.</p><p>Jason's mother assisted him in raising Oshynn as he worked up to three jobs at once. After landing a stable job at a friend's new pub, Jason began to develop contacts.</p><p>He now works incessantly and supports his daughter solely on his musician's salary. With his band, Jason Arcilla & the Rhythm Sons, he performs at resorts, private gatherings, brunches, weddings, and other venues.</p><p>Jason's family was affected by the flames in <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">Hawaii</a>, but he feels he is on the show for a purpose.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/5a13f784-86d2-48bb-8d27-5f7b32ad2993.png><h2 class=split>Who is Eli Ward on 'The Voice' Season 24?</h2><p>Eli's interest in music began when his mother enrolled him in piano lessons at the age of five. Later, he trained himself to play the drums and guitar, and he began creating songs.</p><p>Eli had to learn to balance his multiple abilities in high school. He'd play jazz band before school, track after school, and then drumline after that, all while keeping excellent enough marks to be in the National Honor Society.</p><p>Eli is a cross-country track and field athlete representing the University of Iowa. When Eli runs, he breathes to the beat of the music he's listening to, and his runs may last up to 16 kilometers.</p><p>Eli, now a senior in college, has made the difficult choice to leave the squad in order to focus on music. He's in a band, and they occasionally play country covers.</p><p>Eli, on the other hand, wishes to concentrate on performing his own work, which is more singer-songwriter/pop.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/75b10a3a-16d4-4252-821b-b9551016d565.png><p>'The Voice' Season 24 airs on Mondays at 8 pm and Tuesdays at 9 pm ET on <a href=# rel>NBC.</a></p><span class=readpage-disclaimer>This article contains remarks made on the Internet by individual people and organizations.
