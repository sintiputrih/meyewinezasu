She made her acting debut in <i>Not Wanted</i> (1949), written and produced by Ida Lupino. The film's controversial subject of unwed motherhood was a raw and unsentimental view of a condition that was rarely explored by Hollywood at that time. Forrest starred in two more Lupino projects, <i>Never Fear</i> (1949) and <i>Hard, Fast and Beautiful</i> (1951), as well as other film noir films, including <i>Mystery Street</i> (1950), directed by <a href=#>John Sturges</a>, and the star-studded <i>While the City Sleeps</i> (1956), directed by Fritz Lang. Her musical background and training as a jazz and ballet <a href=#>Dancer</a> brought roles in the transitional musicals that rounded off the golden age of MGM; most notable was <i>Excuse My Dust</i> (1951).</p><span>1953</span><p>In 1953, after moving to New York with her husband, <a href=#>Writer</a> and <a href=#>Producer</a> Milo Frank (who was hired to be head of casting for CBS), her film work transitioned to theatre and TV. She starred on Broadway in <i>The Seven Year Itch</i>, and appeared in major stage productions of <i>Damn Yankees</i>, <i>Bus Stop</i>, <i>As You Like It</i> and <i>No No Nanette</i>. Later she returned to Hollywood and continued working at RKO and Columbia Pictures. Her final film was RKO's <i>While the City Sleeps</i> in 1956, a murder mystery co-starring Dana Andrews, Rhonda Fleming, Vincent Price and her frequent collaborator Ida Lupino.</p><span>1955</span><p>Most of her films were made under contract to MGM, which prided itself as family entertainment, but RKO, headed by the eccentric and controlling Howard Hughes, presented a very different creative challenge. <i>Son of <a href=#>Sinbad</a></i> (1955), now a cult classic, was one of his many pet projects where he had a personal interest in re-designing the star's skimpy wardrobe. With each rehearsal, Forrest noticed her harem dance costume slowly disappearing, until it was barely compliant with the Motion Picture Production Code.</p><span>2015</span><p>Forrest, a widow since 2004, died of cancer on March 15, 2015, aged 86, at her home in Beverly Hills, <a href=#>California</a>. She was survived by her niece, Sharon Durham, and nephews, Michael and Mark Feeney.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>1928 births</a> <a href=#>2015 deaths</a> <a href=#>Actresses from San Diego</a> <a href=#>American film actresses</a> <a href=#>American female dancers</a> <a href=#>20th-century American dancers</a> <a href=#>American stage actresses</a> <a href=#>American television actresses</a> <a href=#>American people of Irish descent</a> <a href=#>Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer contract players</a> <a href=#>20th-century American actresses</a> <a href=#>Deaths from cancer in California</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmejlrmtxYyfpquqlajBbrrErWSwp6KptW6Dkm5ucg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ouleye-ndoye.html><span>←</span><span>Ouleye Ndoye - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Facts</span></a>
