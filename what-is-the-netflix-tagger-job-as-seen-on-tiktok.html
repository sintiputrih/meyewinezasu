It seems like it appeals to anyone who likes to watch television and movies, which covers just about everyone. The job is called being a tagger, and the concept is really quite simple. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Watch what‚Äôs streaming on Netflix</a>, and tag it with appropriate genres and categories.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=185 data-current-count=185 data-injectable=false>Recently, TikToker, businessbabe1.0, posted a short review of the job that covered a few brief aspects. Everything she said seemed true at first glance, but there is more to the story.</p><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true>The TikToker is also known by the name Ramona, and she often reviews how to make extra money on the side. When she makes the claim that a tagger can make $45 an hour, that information can‚Äôt be verified. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix Jobs</a> search engine doesn‚Äôt produce a job listing for tagger until a position is actually open. That‚Äôs when anyone interested might be able to see the compensation.</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=237 data-injectable=false>It‚Äôs not simply a job about watching what‚Äôs streaming all day and then declaring with authority whether a movie is a romance or a comedy. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Today</a> did an interview years ago with a true-life tagger and found out the real scoop.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=537 data-injectable=true><a title=@ramonatheaffiliate href=#>@ramonatheaffiliate</a><p>Did you know that Netflix pay you to watch movies?ü´£ <a title=netflix href=#>#netflix</a> <a title=workfromhomejobs href=#>#workfromhomejobs</a> <a title=makemoneyfromhome2022 href=#>#makemoneyfromhome2022</a> <a title=highpayingjobs href=#>#highpayingjobs</a> <a title=sidehustlesecrets href=#>#sidehustlesecrets</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Ramona | Makemoneywme" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì Ramona | Makemoneywme</a></figure><h2 id=h-what-is-the-reality-of-being-a-netflix-tagger data-injectable=false>What is the reality of being a Netflix tagger?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/netflix-tagger.png><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=673 data-injectable=true>Although it seems easy-peasy on TikTok, what Today found out from actual tagger, Greg Harty, is that working two hours a day isn‚Äôt realistic. According to him, he was one of the first taggers when he was hired back in 2006. He knew a guy who knew a guy and, bada bing bada boom, he was talking to an interviewer from Netflix about movies for an hour and got the job.</p><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=213 data-injectable=false>‚ÄúMy friend knew I had a pretty good film background,‚Äù Harty explained. ‚ÄúI watched a lot of movies, and I took a film class for aspiring screenwriters. So I sent my resume in, and I got a call.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=207 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>Considering this was back in 2006, Netflix has definitely stepped up a more sophisticated application process for prospective taggers. They can‚Äôt simply be movie buffs who like to watch movies all day.</p><p data-characters=200 data-current-count=200 data-injectable=false>Having strong writing skills and a creative mind are integral to the job. Giving a movie the category of cerebral romantic psychodrama is a bit more involved than simply saying <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it‚Äôs a thriller</a>.</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=524 data-injectable=false>When the job opens, there is a very short window of time, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">as thousands of resumes</a> come flying from all directions at Netflix executives who have to sort through them. Be vigilant and possibly create an alert for when the job opens. While it‚Äôs not as easy as TikTok made it seem, it still might be a dream job for many.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGZpGK2tHnToZxmppWps62112armp%2BXmr9uts6bZJqrXaiyprqMqKVmrJmgwbC3jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./theo-epstein-net-worth-2024.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Theo Epstein Net Worth 2024</span></a>
