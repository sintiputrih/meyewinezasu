Kanye made a trip to the Isle of Skye in Scotland for the video shoot, with a Scottish publication, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Daily Record,</a>&nbsp;reporting on his stay there. According to their report, Kanye and his team stayed at&nbsp;the&nbsp;Skeabost House Hotel, where they occupied half of the hotel's fourteen rooms.&nbsp;"Kanye was the perfect guest - charming, courteous and polite,"&nbsp;one of the hotel owners said,&nbsp;"We were delighted to offer him and his companions our usual Highland hospitality and would welcome him back any time."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">A spokesman for the hotel then went into detail about Kanye's stay, although details about the video shoot itself are extremely slim. Still, the spokesman revealed, "It was all very exciting. The reservation, which included one room for Kanye, then one for his stylist and others for the video team had been booked out a few days in advance." He continued, "The staff at the hotel say he chatted to everyone. Photographs were banned. But they said he was just like one of the guys really. They did ask if <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kim Kardashian</a> West was part of his entourage, but they were told she was elsewhere. He was very busy and didn’t have a lot of time. He was definitely here to work."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Are you excited for a "Waves" music video?
