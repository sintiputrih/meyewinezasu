He is a singer and actor known under the professional name Raz-B, but other names under which he has performed have been De’ mario Monte Thornton, Raz B, DeMario Thornton and Raz-Berry. He is perhaps best known as the founding member of the boy band titled B2K. Raz-B has been accumulating his net worth being active in show business since 2001.</p><p>How rich is this singer and actor? It has been estimated that the size of Raz-B’s net worth is as much as $1.5 million, accumulated during a career spanning 15 years.</p><h3>Raz-B Net Worth $1.5 Million</h3><p>Raz-B debuted in the entertainment industry as a member of the R&B band B2K in 2001. The boy band was immediately successful in the industry when releasing the studio album “B2K” (2002) which topped the Billboard R&B Top and took the second position of the main music chart in the USA.; the album was certified gold thus adding significant sums to the net worth of Raz-B and other members of the band. This was followed by another studio album “Pandemonium!” (2002) which was even more successful than the first one, and appeared not only on the music charts in the USA but also in the European ones. Moreover, “Pandemonium!” has been certified platinum according to sales in the USA. Their last studio album “B2K Greatest Hits” (2004), however, wasn’t as successful as the first two, and B2K decided to fall apart.</p><p>Subsequently, Raz-B appeared on the stage as a solo artist, and releasing the studio album “FIRE” (2007). Even though it failed to enter the Billboard Top 100, the album contained a number of well known singles including “Fire”, “Go Girl”, “Official”, “Na Na Na” and “Follow My Lead” which was produced by Excel Beats. In 2010, during a concert he was hit on the head while trying to break-up a disturbance in the audience, reportedly fell into coma, but actually recovered quickly and returned to performing.</p><p>In 2013, he signed a contract with the record label Kameleon Music Group, and the artist got back to studio and was busy recording the new single; “From the garden” (2015) featuring Fioso has been released recently. Currently, Raz-B is again engaged recording the new studio album which is going to be released in 2015, too. Both albums benefited his net worth.</p><p>Another source of Raz-B’s net worth is acting. In the feature film he first starred alongside his R&B boy band members; “You Got Served” (2004) directed by <a href=#>Chris Stokes</a> was financially profitable as the box office grossed $48 million although the critics reviews were mixed. Later, Raz-B landed roles in the films “Pieces of a Dream” (2005) directed by Skee Skinner, “Love Sick Diaries” (2010) written and directed by Mike Ahuja and “Caged Innocence” (2009) written and directed by Anne Leigh Cooper. To add more, Raz-B appeared on television screens. He appeared in the episode of cable television dramedy “Noah’s Arc” (2006). All these projects added steadily to his net worth</p><p>Regarding the personal life of the artist, it is known that he was in relationship with Moniece Slaughter for some time. However, he now states that he is single.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=9.051724137931><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Raz-B</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1.5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>June 13, 1985</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Cleveland, Ohio, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 6 in (1.68 m)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Profession</td><td>Record producer, Actor, Singer-songwriter, Author</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Siblings</td><td>Storm Thornton, Ricardo Thornton</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Nicknames</td><td>De' mario Monte Thornton , Raz B , DeMario Thornton , Raz-Berry</td></tr><tr readability=0.38888888888889><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/razb2k</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm1215800</a></td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>You Got Served</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=4.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>The nickname Raz B came about because of his "raspy" voice.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2</td><td>Plans on releasing a gospel LP (March 2004).</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Was in the quartet, B2K.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>4</td><td>His cousin is Chris Stokes, who is his former manager.
