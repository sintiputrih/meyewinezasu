One of the more friendly faces you can find is Baelen, a mushroom picker exploring the Underdark. Unfortunately, he’s gotten himself into a load of trouble.</p><p data-injection=true>You find him in the middle of a <strong>massive field of Bibberbang mushrooms</strong>, which will explode if you get too close to them or attempt to attack him. When you get close to this field, Baelen will explain his situation to you and insist you get his bag to him. Here’s what you need to know about how to save Baelen and get his bag to him in Baldur’s Gate 3.</p><h2>Where to Find Baelen in Baldur’s Gate 3</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Baelen-location-in-Baldurs-Gate-3.jpg><p data-injection=true>I was able to locate Baelen by traveling to the <strong>north of the Selunite Outpost</strong> in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur’s Gate 3</a>. From there,<strong> I made my way to the west, and traversed through the Underdark</strong>, taking on a handful of creatures. Thankfully, I only encountered one combat fight, but it was against a Bulette, a large, lizard-like creature that digs underground and bursts underneath your party. After going beyond a tree, blue glowing tree, I found Baelen. He was in a rather dangerous situation, and I had to do my best to find a way to get him out.</p><p>When I arrived at this area, <strong>Baelen made sure I didn’t get too much closer. He explained he needed to escape using whatever was in his bag</strong>. However, these <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mushrooms will explode</a> in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> if you get too close. You don’t have too many options to reach this point, but there is a direct way to bypass these mushrooms and ensure they never explode.</p><h2>How to Get Baelen to Safety in Baldur’s Gate 3</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Misty-Step-in-Baldurs-Gate-3.jpg><p>It all comes down to using a spell: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Misty Step</strong></a>. Misty Step is a helpful spell in Baldur’s Gate 3 that, when used, will allow a character to teleport to a specific location that they see. This is not a spell you can use in an infinite range, but you should be able to teleport to Baelen’s bag and arrive right next to it.</p><p data-injection=true>When you look inside Baelen’s bag, he has a handful of items. <strong>The item Baelen wanted you to get for him was Misty Step</strong>. Similar to conjuring the spell yourself, using the scroll will activate the spell, and the user can use it to teleport away. You’ll need to throw it to Baelen. To do this in Baldur’s Gate, pick up the Misty Step scroll from Baelen’s bag, find it in your inventory, and select the option to throw it. You can toss it close to Baelen, and he’ll pick it up to activate and teleport safely.</p><p>This is not the only way to get him out. If you can use a spell that can teleport Baelen to you, or find a way to bring him safely away all of the exploding mushrooms in your Baldur’s Gate 3 playthrough, he can be saved without using the Misty Step scroll you find in his bag, but this is one of the better ways to get him away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Throwing-an-Item-in-Baldurs-Gate-3-Misty-Step.jpg><p>The last thing to do is your character back to safety and speak with Baelen. <strong>He’ll be thankful for what you did in helping him get out of that situation</strong>. He rewards you with a scroll of Invisibility. However, if you want a bigger reward, make your way to Derryth to earn even more.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/17c418c90324bdc0fbd0bc2ce42fdf32?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Zack Palm</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Zack Palm is the Senior Writer of Gamepur and has spent over five years covering video games, and earned a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Oregon State University.
