(She also sings in Penn Station and 14th Street/Union Square.)</p><p><a href=#>Flashback! See what all the stars wore to the Oscars in 2009</a></p><p>Ridley worked as a nursery-school teacher and a Department of Education teacher's aide before relocating her act to Manhattan’s train stations.</p><p>"For a while, I was teaching and doing the singing, burning the candle at both ends to support my family," she said.&nbsp; She earns enough money every day, "to pay my bills and feed my kids."</p><p>Ridley has traveled to Chile, Argentina and Germany to sing, and been offered more cushy gigs — but she prefers to stay underground.</p><p>"People always say, 'Why don't you sing in clubs?' I tell 'em, 'This is my club,'" she insisted.</p><p>Ridley was offered the mother role in Precious: Based on the Novel 'Push' by Sapphire she says, but she turned it down. Mo'Nique went on to earn an Oscar nomination for the heart-wrenching part.</p><p>Party!

It was just too hard."</p><p>Instead, she passed the novel off to her daughter, 26.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I read the book, and I gave it to Gabby," Ridley said. "Her friends encouraged her to try out for 'Precious,' and she got it."</p><p>Sidibe never intended to become an actress — or a singer, like her mother.</p><p>"Gabby would say, 'No, I'm gonna be a comedian,'" Ridley said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSopV2ks2680Z6aoqelqHq0wMCrZKCZkqTCs7HYZqqinJmXsm6%2FyKeerGWZo3q0wcGwmLJlYmV%2BcYSRaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bruno-fernandes-parents.html><span>←</span><span>Bruno Fernandes Parents, Age, Family, Height, Wife, Children, Net Worth 2022, Salary, Ethnicity, Nat</span></a>
