A Small <b>Plasma</b> TV (Like the ones at the demo stations in stores) would be situated above the machine. Once you insert the Gen I or II Game Pak and Gen IV Game Card into the machine, you would turn on the machine and an option would appear (you would control the menu with a Gamecube controller [don't ask why...]) to transfer the Pokemon to your DS card. Say <b>YES</b> and the boxes from the Game Pak would appear. You would choose the Pokemon you want to transfer to your DS Card (same Pal Park rules APPLY!!!) and say <b>YES</b> two times. Once the machine has done its thing, the machine will turn off and you'd remove your game card and game pak. Once this is done, you'd take out your DS, insert the card, turn it on, bypass the screens, start your game, and go to pal park. And, hey, presto, before you know it your pre-GEN III pokemon would be in your Gen IV card! <a href=# class=new title="User:MudkipNDS (page does not exist)">themaestro2.0</a> 20:21, 29 July 2007 (UTC) Whatever, whatever.

I believe it'll still be Opal, as they already have Giratina in place the way they had Rayquaza last time, while they seem to have picked Suicune at random for Crystal (I doubt they were planning a third version when they made Gold and Silver, although that had become part of a pattern by the next generation). But that's not the point. It could be that I'm absolutely wrong, and it will be Platinum, have Cresselia for a a mascot, and have a wi-fi underground that screws over the players of the other two versions. We can't add any of that, though, because it's unconfirmed.
