When she was 10, she moved to <a href=#>Norway</a> with her family, but later relocated to <a href=#>Vietnam</a> to pursue an entertainment career.</p><span>1999</span><p>In 1999, Ngo returned to <a href=#>Vietnam</a> where she participated in a beauty pageant organized by the magazine <i>Women's World</i>, and finished as second runner-up. Following this initial success, she launched her modelling career in <a href=#>Vietnam</a> as a model for magazines, calendars, and fashion collections. Soon after, she had her first acting role on the small screen in <i>Huong De</i>, a short TV series on HTV Channel.</p><span>2002</span><p>In 2002, Ngo transitioned into the music scene as a pop-dance singer with the help of <a href=#>Producer</a> Quoc Bao. She recorded the duet album called <i>Vuon Tinh Nhan (Lovers' Garden)</i> with established singer Tuan Hung.</p><span>2004</span><p>In 2004, Ngo made her first international appearance in <i>Rouge</i>, a 13-part late night television series aired on AZN Television. 'Rouge' was produced by MTV Asia & MediaCorp <a href=#>Singapore</a> and was broadcast widely in Asia and <a href=#>Australia</a>. For the remainder of the year, Ngo was busy with the promotional campaign for Rouge throughout Asia and the recording of her third album. She was chosen as the favourite <a href=#>Actress</a> in Rouge on the MTV Asia website.</p><span>2005</span><p>On September 5, 2005, <i>My Way</i>, Ngo's third album, was released. This album was produced by Ngo herself and featured a collaboration with a group of producers called <i>The Dreams</i>. My Way featured multiple genres, from alternative rock to pop, R&B, and hip hop. She remixed the famous Trịnh Công Sơn song "Quynh Huong".</p><span>2006</span><p>In 2006, Ngo signed a contract to appear in the long-running music and comedy show <i>Van Son</i>, produced by Van Son Entertainment, an overseas Vietnamese music production company. She has since appeared in every Van Son DVD release to date.</p><span>2007</span><p>After <i>My Way</i>, Ngo engaged herself further in acting, with many starring roles in films such as <i>Saigon Love Story</i> by Ringo Le, <i>2 in 1</i> by Dao Duy Phuc, and <i>The Rebel</i> by <a href=#>Charlie N</a>guyen Chanh Truc with Johnny Trí Nguyễn, the latter becoming (at that point) Vietnam's highest-grossing film of all time. Ngo's performance was highly praised by both critics and the public, and she was nominated for "Best Actress" at the 'Canh Dieu Vang' awards (Vietnam's Oscars) for the second time. In the spring of 2007, Ngo also starred in a new thriller called <i>Ngoi Nha Bi An (Haunted Manor)</i>, which premiered in Vietnamese cinemas in November 2007. That December, Ngo was awarded the "Best Actress" prize at the 15th <a href=#>Vietnam</a> Film Festival.</p><span>2008</span><p>During the first months of 2008, Ngo began working on her next album <i>Nuoc Mat Thien Than (Tears of Angel)</i>, while <i>Studio 68</i> was awarded "Most Creative Album" in a monthly "Album Vang" prize.</p><span>2009</span><p>2009 saw Ngo once again starring beside Johnny Trí Nguyễn in a Chanh Phuong action movie <i>Clash</i>. She also opened her own talent agency called VAA.</p><span>2010</span><p>In December 2010, after 2 years training, NTV presented the first act of her agency, a five-piece boy-band called 365daband.</p><span>2011</span><p>In 2011, Ngo was busy with the promotion of 365daband (a pop boyband she managed), and various commercial contracts. She also played the leading role in the thriller <i>Ngoi Nha Trong Hem</i> (House In The Alley). The movie premiered nationwide in February 2012.</p><span>2017</span><p>In 2017, she played Paige Tico, the older sister to Rose Tico, in <i>The Last Jedi.</i> Although her screen time was brief, her character's death was an important act of self-sacrifice that affected the major characters in the film, especially Rose. Later in 2017, she played Tien, an Inferni elf enforcer working for Leilah, the main antagonist in the Netflix film Bright (film).</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>Living people</a> <a href=#>1979 births</a> <a href=#>Talent managers</a> <a href=#>Norwegian people of Vietnamese descent</a> <a href=#>21st-century Vietnamese actresses</a> <a href=#>Vietnamese female singers</a> <a href=#>Vietnamese dancers</a> <a href=#>People from Tra Vinh Province</a> <a href=#>Vietnamese film actresses</a> <a href=#>Vietnamese television actresses</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmemmr%2BwusicmGaml6R6r7HTZq6oqqSdenl%2Fk3Fr</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./simon-helberg.html><span>←</span><span>Simon Helberg Age, Net Worth, Wife, Family &amp;amp; Biography</span></a>
