"I swore off dating and decided to focus only on myself, my music, my growth, and my female friendships. If I only hung out with my female friends, people couldn’t sensationalize or sexualize that—right? I would learn later on that people could and people would."&nbsp;</p><p id=etU5VJX8AM data-wc=58>Later in the prologue she also downplayed rumors of being a member of the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>LGBTQ</a>+ community by referencing the "seeds of allyship and advocating for equality" that she began to sow in the opening track 'Welcome to New York,' which includes the lyrics: "And you can want who you want / Boys and boys and girls and girls.”&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><h2>Did Taylor Swift fans think she dated Dianna Agron?</h2><p id=enzCpnBq2g data-wc=59>Karlie is not the only female friend of Taylor's that people believe she has dated.
