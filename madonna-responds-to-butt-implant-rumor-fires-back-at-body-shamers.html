Another said of her tush, “I’m a fan 4life and it’s you’re [sic] prerogative…I just wish the physician would’ve done a better job.” Others commenters were complimentary of both the keister and the celebrity. “Stunning as always,” one wrote.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Meanwhile, Us Weekly has heard whispers that the Desperately Seeking Susan actress did indeed get butt implants about six months ago. A rep for the singer has not responded to a request for comment.</p><p>Over her decades in the spotlight, the youthful-looking mother of six — <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Lourdes Leon</strong></a>, 22, Rocco Ritchie, 18, David Banda Mwale Ciccone Ritchie, 13, Mercy James, 12, and 6-year-old twin daughters, Stelle Ciccone and Estere Ciccone — has faced plenty of plastic surgery speculation, though the outspoken star has never confirmed going under the knife. She has, however, been very vocal about staying in shape and following a strict, clean eating regimen. Madonna was one of Hollywood’s early adopters in touting the benefits of a macrobiotic diet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGammZSku6%2BtjKucrKifo7G0edOoZJutpKl6qrnPpZinrF2nwq670WadoqqVqHqjrcKkZJqsXZe8pcWMrJ%2BapZWnwHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-is-robert-kardashian-jrs-net-worth-in-2023.html><span>←</span><span>How Much is Robert Kardashian Jrs Net Worth in 2023</span></a>
