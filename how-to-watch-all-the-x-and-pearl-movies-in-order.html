<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>How to watch all the X and Pearl movies in order</h1></header><section class=post-content><p data-characters=480 data-injectable=true data-video=true>Over a year ago, director <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ti West</a> — an established name in the horror sector — dropped a subtle bombshell in <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">X</a></strong>, an under-promoted gem that flew under the radar for some time, despite being a product of production company A24, known at this time for Midsommar, The Witch, and Hereditary. West returns to his horror roots with X, having previously worked throughout the 2000s on supernatural horrors, namely The Roost, The House of the Devil, The Innkeepers, and The Sacrament.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=263 data-current-count=263 data-injectable=false>In 2022, A24 announced that it would produce X, the beginning of a planned trilogy, but when the COVID-19 pandemic halted production, West took the downtime to write the entire screenplay for <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pearl</a></strong>, a prequel to X that was eventually filmed back-to-back with it.</p><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=690 data-injectable=true>Following the resounding success of both, West revealed that he’d been focusing his efforts on a sequel to X that would be fittingly titled MaXXXine. We know that the series’ third entry is currently filming at the time of writing, but judging by the order of release versus the chronological timeline, it can be confusing as to which of West’s projects should precede the other. Which came first, X or Pearl?</p><h2 id=h-pearl-1918 data-injectable=false>Pearl (1918)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Pearl-Title-Card.jpg><p data-characters=597 data-current-count=897 data-injectable=true>Technically, Pearl didn’t hit theaters until later in 2022, several months after the hype for X had dissipated. However, as far as the lore is concerned, Pearl precedes X by just over 60 years. Set in 1918 during the influenza pandemic and the World War I era, Pearl sees its titular villain living an unrewarding life as a live-in caretaker for her sickly father and an errand girl for her overbearing mother. She longs for much more than this provincial life can offer, so as she becomes captivated by the films she sees at the local movie theater, Pearl dreams of becoming a chorus girl.</p><p data-characters=451 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>Although she auditions to join a local troupe, the judges reject her, resulting in fits of rage that don’t bode well for her German immigrant parents, nor the handsome projectionist she’d seduced while frequenting the movie theater. Pearl not only provides a backstory for West’s main antagonist, but it also acts as a deep dive into the character’s psyche and makes her actions in X all the more terrifying with added context.</p><h2 id=h-x-1979 data-injectable=false>X (1979)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/X-Movie-Teaser.jpg><p data-characters=469 data-current-count=769 data-injectable=true>Although it came before Pearl, the trilogy kick-starter should be enjoyed second to complement the villain’s origins. Flash-forward to 1979 and Pearl — along with Howard — is delusional, decrepit, and despondent about her girlish good looks, which have withered away over time. Even as old age ruins her, Pearl laments her youth and expresses jealousy towards Maxine, who lives the free-spirited, sexually non-confining life she’d only ever dreamed of.</p><p data-characters=535 data-current-count=535 data-injectable=true>Maxine travels with a filmmaking crew, who pay Howard to use the guest house on their property for the purpose of shooting a pornographic film, an intention unbeknownst to the homeowners at the time. Pearl grows jealous of Maxine, which isn’t a foreign feeling to her, considering how enraged she felt when her sister-in-law Mitsy bagged the spot in the troupe that she desperately wanted all those years ago. Needless to say, things don’t end well, especially as Howard persistently rejects Pearl’s sexual advances.</p><h2 id=h-maxxxine-1985 data-injectable=false>MaXXXine (1985)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/MaXXXine-Teaser.jpg><p data-characters=483 data-current-count=783 data-injectable=true>And that leaves us with MaXXXine, the upcoming slasher to round out the trilogy. Naturally, Mia Goth will be reprising her role as Maxine Minx, the sole survivor of the massacre that occurred during the events of X. Now 1985, Maxine moves to Los Angeles to pursue her dream of becoming a famous actress, setting out on a quest for fame and success in Hollywood. We know that A24 — like the other installments — will be distributing, while Little Lamb and Mad Solar will produce.</p><p data-characters=585 data-current-count=585 data-injectable=true>Ti West returns once again, but perhaps the most enticing aspect of MaXXXine is its supporting cast, which includes Elizabeth Debicki&nbsp;as a film director,&nbsp;Michelle Monaghan&nbsp;and&nbsp;Bobby Cannavale&nbsp;as LAPD detectives,&nbsp;Giancarlo Esposito&nbsp;as an agent for the adult film industry, and&nbsp;Kevin Bacon&nbsp;as a private investigator. We also know that Moses Sumney,&nbsp;Lily Collins,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Halsey have been cast in undisclosed roles. MaXXXine doesn’t have a confirmed release date yet, but we’ll be expecting one soon after filming wraps.</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=240 data-injectable=false>Both X and Pearl are currently available for streaming on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Paramount Plus</a>. However, if you run into any location-based restrictions trying to stream through this platform, you might want to consider using a VPN (or Virtual Private Network).</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=550 data-injectable=true>VPNs allow you to alter your viewing location to another country and access more shows & movies across all your streaming platforms of choice. The easiest way to get a VPN is by signing up for a paid VPN service, such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">ExpressVPN</a> or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">NordVPN</a>. Even better, both options offer a 30-day money-back guarantee.</p><p data-characters=152 data-current-count=152 data-injectable=false>We Got This Covered is supported by our audience.
