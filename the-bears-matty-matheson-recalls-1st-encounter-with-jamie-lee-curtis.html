We were in the ballroom, and there weren’t a lot of people in there.”</p><p>Matheson said he asked <i>The Bear</i> series creator <b>Christopher Storer</b>, “Can I just go up and say hello to her?”</p><p>“And he was like, ‘For sure! Go say what’s up!’” Matheson recalled.</p><p>He added, “As I was walking up to her, she pointed at me and was like, ‘I know who the f—k you are! Get over here!’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/The-Bear-Matty-Matheson-Recalls-1st-Encounter-With-Jamie-Lee-Curtis-2.jpg><p>The duo “just hit it off” from the star, with Matheson gushing that Curtis, 65, is “so sweet.”</p><p>“She’s our big mama,” he added. “She hangs with us the whole time, even when she’s not on screen. Being around someone like that, a true icon, is amazing. <i>Trading Places</i> is my family’s movie. We loved that movie growing up. Never in a million years — and now we’re friends! We’re texting! She really is an incredible person.”</p><p>Matheson has been on <i>The Bear</i> since season 1, which premiered in 2022, playing the role of Neil Fak while also serving as a culinary consultant and producer on the show.</p><p>Curtis, for her part, appeared on the second season of the FX Original series as Donna, the Berzatto family matriarch. She briefly returned in season 3, which debuted on Wednesday, June 26.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/The-Bear-Matty-Matheson-Recalls-1st-Encounter-With-Jamie-Lee-Curtis-3.jpg><p>Last month, Curtis told <a href=# rel=noopener><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a> that “none of us said a word to anyone” about her cameo, noting that the producers “changed the name on the buses, the vans — the call sheets didn’t have our names on them.”</p><p>She added, “We flew to Chicago. There was no connection back to the show. There was no word ‘Bear’ anywhere near me. I stayed at a hotel, the hotel didn’t know who was paying for my room. It was a secret until the day it dropped.”</p><p>The series stars <b>Jeremy Allen White</b> as Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto, a chef who takes over his family’s Italian beef sandwich shop in Chicago. Winning 10 Primetime <a href=# rel>Emmy Awards</a> in its first season, the show has also earned four <a href=#>Golden Globes</a>, taking home Best Television Series — Musical or Comedy earlier this year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuhnV2XsqK%2B0makmqykrnqurdOhnKynnmK%2Fpq%2FApaOsZWGowW6xzZymrqakmr9uw8itn2aikaK2pnnLnpxmm6Wnwaq%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./monique-robinson-bio-love-after-lockup-age-job-ig.html><span>←</span><span>Meet Monique Robinson!
