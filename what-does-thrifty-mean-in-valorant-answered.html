Answered</h1></header><section class=post-content>Recommended Videos<p>Central to a Valorant team’s success is their round-to-round economy, with their pool of credits in reserve directly purchasing the weapons and gear that they’ll need to win. However, after a string of costly deaths and a few lost rounds, these credits will dry up, forcing players to get creative with their purchases to win on a tight budget. These tight-walleted situations have given birth to “Thrifty” plays and the “Thrifty” playstyle.</p><h2>“Thrifty” in Valorant, explained</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/27064020/Spectre_hivemind_VALORANT-850x478.jpg><p>In the event that “Thrifty” appears on screen after a round, it means that the winning team managed to secure the round despite the limited weapons and gear they bought. For the game to recognize a “Thrifty” round win, all five players of the winning team must have purchased less than 2,500 credits worth of weapons and utility items.</p><p data-injection=true><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Which Valorant Agent should I use? The best Agent for your playstyle</a></p><p>In the event that your team’s finances are pushed to their limits, there are several inexpensive weapons that can competently earn you a “Thrifty” round win. For example, the Spectre sub-machine gun operates like a lighter, cheaper alternative to the fully-fledged Phantom rifle at 1,600 credits, where its suppressor allows you to make aggressive plays on better-equipped players or&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">spray through active smoke</a>&nbsp;without giving away your position. The Shorty shotgun, at a very affordable 150 credits, can quickly eliminate opponents within very close range, allowing you to immediately salvage their dropped weaponry on a shoestring budget.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/71cbda4f096528433fdaf76fe4b519db?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Tom Griffin</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc></p><h4><a href=#>More Stories by Tom Griffin</a></h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qK3Mnqeuql6YvK57xq6gnZ2jZMSprdNmm6ido2LBqb7In6uyZZ2arq95yKdkr5mcpL%2BiutNmmKerp5q%2FprA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sophie-winkleman-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Sophie Winkleman Net Worth</span></a>
