If Bazinet is right, the cost to get those rights back will include losing the streaming service <a href=#>Hulu.</a></p><p>In his letter, Bazinet points out that <a href=#>Disney</a> owns 67 precent of Hulu, while the remaining 33 percent is held by Comcast — the same company that currently holds the distribution rights to Hulk and Namor. As of January 2024, <a class=wpil_keyword_link title=Disney data-wpil-keyword-link=linked href=# rel=noopener>Disney</a> has the option of buying out Comcast’s share, while the latter company can reportedly force Disney to buy them out if they choose. Before either of those scenarios can happen, Bazinet writes, Disney may be looking to sell its <a class=wpil_keyword_link title=Hulu data-wpil-keyword-link=linked href=# rel=noopener>Hulu</a> shares to Comcast with the Hulk and Namor distribution rights being part of Comcast’s payment.</p><p>Bazinet doesn’t think getting the Hulk and Namor rights are the only reasons Disney would sell Hulu either. The <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=streaming data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>streaming</a> platform is a successful one, which is reportedly subscribed to by 44 percent of American households, but Bazinet believes Disney has grown less interested in “mass market DTC [direct to consumer] offering.”</p><p>As it stands now, if <a href=#>Marvel Studios</a> were to release solo movies for Hulk and/or Namor, Comcast would have the right to stream those films on Peacock. Disney would likely have to work out a separate deal to stream them on Disney+.</p><p>It would be questionable whether or not the distribution rights to Hulk and Namor would be worth quite so much to Disney. The two live-action Hulk movies to be released so far both underperformed. Mark Ruffalo has received a much warmer reception as Bruce Banner than either Eric Bana or Edward Norton did, but that’s been so far in mostly ensemble affairs like the <a href=#>Avengers</a> films.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/she-hulk-series-premiere-900x506.jpeg><p>There’s also the question of whether or not Mark Ruffalo would want to appear in a solo Hulk movie at this point. If you count his cameos in Iron Man 3 and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, he’s appeared in seven MCU films so far and the Disney+ series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law.</p><p>The aquatic Namor has only appeared in one <a class=wpil_keyword_link title=Marvel data-wpil-keyword-link=linked href=# rel=noopener>Marvel</a> feature so far — in last year’s Black Panther: Wakanda Forever — and that was as an antagonist.</p><p>In the meantime, one has to wonder whether or not Disney really wants to throw more resources toward more Marvel superhero blockbusters. <a class=wpil_keyword_link title=Ant-Man data-wpil-keyword-link=linked href=# rel=noopener>Ant-Man</a> and The Wasp: Quantumania proved to be yet one more piece of a disturbing trend — of Marvel movies receiving diminishing returns both from critics and at the box office. Does Disney really want to sell a profitable streaming platform for, in part, two superhero properties now that so-called superhero fatigue may finally be here?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ilk6p6qcHLpGSmmaKgerPBxZ%2BYpaddncKtwY2hq6ak</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sky-beach-hotel-entebbe-entebbe.html><span>←</span><span>Sky Beach Hotel Entebbe, Entebbe,</span></a>
