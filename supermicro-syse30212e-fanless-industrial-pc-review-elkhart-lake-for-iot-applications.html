In addition to avoiding moving parts, systems meant for industrial use need to be built to operate 24x7 in challenging environmental conditions.</p><p>Supermicro has <a href=#>systems targeting this market</a> under the Embedded / IoT category in a variety of form-factors. Scenarios with minimal I/O requirements can use the compact chassis with support for 3.5" SBCs. The company also provides passively-cooled chassis configurations for industrial mini-ITX boards.</p><p>The <a href=#>Supermicro SYS-E302-12E</a> based on the Intel Atom x6425E embedded SoC is the company's highest performing system in the Elkhart Lake lineup. It is optimized for industrial automation, digital signage / data visualization, and IoT applications. The review below takes a detailed look at the features and performance profile of the system, along with an evaluation of the thermal solution.</p><h2>Introduction and Product Impressions</h2><p>Supermicro's SYS-E302-12E is based on the <a href=#>Super A3SEV-4C-LN4</a> mini-ITX board. The board is available for <a href=#>purchase</a> with an integrated heatsink. Supermicro also offers the SYS-E302-12E barebones system based on this board by removing the heatsink and mounting the board inside the CSE-E302iL2 passively-cooled chassis.</p><p>Intel's Tremont microarchitecture for low-cost processors has been available in the market for a few years now in Jasper Lake-based systems meant for use as entry-level PCs. Processors meant for the embedded market (such as the Elkhart Lake SoCs) make it to end customers much later than their consumer counterparts - they have a long life-cycle, and lengthy qualification cycles too. Even though Elkhart Lake-based consumer systems are already trickling into the market, the ones based on embedded SKUs such as the Atom x6425E are becoming widely available only now.</p><p>The SYS-E302-12E is marketed as an IoT SuperServer, but it doesn't have a separate BMC and also does not support ECC memory. However, the embedded SKU officially supports in-band ECC. We have already evaluated the impacts of in-band ECC on performance in our <a href=#>Raptor Lake-P review</a>. Unfortunately, the BIOS version currently available for the SYS-E302-12E doesn't have the option to toggle in-band ECC, but Supermicro confirmed that an upcoming release would enable that option.</p><p>Supermicro has equipped the SYS-E302-12E with a wide range of I/O interfaces - four RS232 COM ports, four gigabit LAN ports, six USB 2.0 ports, and two USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports. There are three display outputs, and there is space available inside the chassis to install a 2.5" SATA drive also.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/18744/first-page_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>In addition to the main unit, Supermicro supplies a lockable 150W (12V @ 12.5A) adapter, AC power cord, 2.5" drive caddy, appropriate screws, and cable ties in the package.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/18744/pkgcont_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Our review sample included 2x 16 GB DDR4-2666 SODIMMs as well as a 256 GB InnoDisk M.2 SATA drive.

Supermicro is still in the process of expanding retail availability.</p><p>The SYS-E302-12E is a bit of a unique system compared to the embedded / industrial PCs we have reviewed earlier. For starters, it is one of the first systems to officially support in-band ECC. The wealth of network ports and other communication options is not matched by any other low-power fanless system we have covered earlier. The chassis also appears to be a massive overdesign for a 12W TDP SoC - keen observers might have noticed that it is the same one that successfully handled a 60W TDP Xeon-D in the <a href=#>SuperServer E302-9D</a>. We can expect the thermal performance to be top-notch and allow the system to operate in a wide temperature range.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/18744/A3SEV-4C-LN4-board_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The top view of the motherboard integrated in the system is show above. The heatsink shown is replaced by a solid metal block that tightly interfaces with the chassis top using a thermal pad. The M.2 SATA port and SODIMMs are easily accessible, but the x8 PCIe slot is not usable in the system (the space meant for the PCIe add-in card is instead allocated to the 2.5" drive tray).</p><p>In the next section, we take a look at the system setup and provide some analysis of the platform.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH55g5NtZqytoJq%2FrrXCq6Zmq6mosnR8kWppnmWWlrutsdKsZKKmlKrAtb7ImqNmqJNiv6bCyJ6uZp2coLWivtNmo5qjlWKzsL6MoqatZZGlva21wpqroqeeqA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-ethnicity-is-jennifer-connelly-what-made-jennifer-connelly-famous.html><span>←</span><span>What ethnicity is Jennifer Connelly?
