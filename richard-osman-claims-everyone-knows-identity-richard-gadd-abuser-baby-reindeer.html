For those who have yet to watch the breakout drama, which is currently the streaming platform's number-one show, it's a semi-autobiographical series based on Gadd's one-man Edinburgh Fringe show.&nbsp;
The series follows struggling comedian Donny Dunn, who is relentlessly stalked by a middle-aged woman named Martha after offering her a free cup of tea during a pub shift, forcing him to confront the trauma caused by sexual abuse at the hands of a TV writer named Darrien during the early days of Donny's comedy career."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
