Then again, when isn’t he having a moment? He may have made his movie debut in 1986. But the years since haven’t diminished the John Wick actor’s intrigue or his beauty; if anything, the decades have simply enhanced his appeal. And now, at 54 years old, Reeves is living his best life.</p><p>The Hawaii native first gained widespread fame as affable stoner Ted in 1989’s Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure. But oversized vests, t-shirts and <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a> didn’t remain his thing! Instead, he morphed into <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a style star</a> on the red carpet — and an action hero at the box office, wooing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Sandra Bullock</strong></a>’s Annie as Jack in 1994’s Speed, and solving the time-space continuum as slick Neo in The Matrix in 1999. Later, he rose to dominate pop culture again in 2010 as “Sad Keanu,” when a photograph of him looking pensive while eating a sandwich alone on a NYC bench became an instant meme.</p><p>More recently, with his raven locks and perfect facial hair more grown-out — it’s the rare man who can make a full beard and mustache look just as sexy as the in-between stubble — the indie actor has his grooming and beauty game down pat.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>And his fashion choices are second to none. Typically, the star, who has a much-talked-about cameo in <strong>Ali Wong</strong>’s 2019 Netflix hit Always Be My Maybe, dresses in a well-tailored dark suit for premieres and talk shows. On his buzzy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Stephen Colbert</strong></a> appearance in June 2019 — yup, the one in which he thoughtfully answered what he thinks happens when we die (“I know that the ones who love us will miss us” — he paired a black shirt, black pants and black blazer with a black tie. From time to time, he’ll even add thick, dark-rimmed glasses to his look — causing, well, quite a spectacle.</p><p>No matter where he is or what he’s doing, Reeves makes his sartorial choices count — and for that, we salute him.
