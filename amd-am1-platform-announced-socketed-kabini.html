Then a couple of weeks later, <a href=#>we reported</a> on a leak regarding several PGA system-on-chips with the Kabini name destined for the FS1b socket.&nbsp; Today AMD is formalizing that announcement into the AM1 platform – A Kabini APU combined with a socketed FS1b motherboard.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/7824/AM1_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>We have examined Kabini in the laptop and mobile space; however AMD sees a market particularly in regions with low GDP.&nbsp; Users of these markets have asked for low cost systems that remain upgradable.&nbsp; With the AM1 platform, AMD is aiming for a combined SoC and motherboard in the $60 region, remaining socketed for an upgrade path.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/7824/Low%20GDP_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The Kabini processors will be similar to their laptop counterparts – up to four Jaguar based CPU cores, a single memory controller supporting up to 1600 MHz memory and 128 streaming processors from the Graphics Core Next architecture.&nbsp; Due to the SoC element of the CPU, there is no chipset on the motherboard and all the IO will be present on the CPU itself. &nbsp;This should help drive the cost of the motherboards down such that another IC does not need to be engineered in. &nbsp;The Kabini APUs will source two SATA 6 Gbps ports, two USB 3.0 ports, eight USB 2.0 ports, four PCIe 2.0 lanes and a trio of video outputs (DisplayPort, HDMI, and VGA).</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/7824/Socket%20APU_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>At launch, on April 9th, AMD have 15 motherboards planned from the major motherboard manufacturers.&nbsp; They will mostly be in the micro-ATX form factor, with a couple in the mini-ITX size.&nbsp; We reported on several motherboards from Computex and CES, such as this from MSI:</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/7824/MSI%20Mobos%20%284%29_575px.JPG style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>With the use of four PCIe 2.0 lanes, AMD is not expecting these systems to be used with anything other than a low end discrete graphics card (R5 230 or GT210) for more screens.&nbsp; The bandwidth would be limiting, and as a result anything other than low-resolution/low-quality gaming would be possible.&nbsp; Also, no dual graphics co-operation is currently planned from AMD.</p><p>The list of APUs coming to release, as far as we can tell, still comes from the leak via Chinese VR-Zone. &nbsp;Compared alongside some of the socketed Kabini:</p><table border=0 width=100%><tbody><tr><td class=contentwhite colspan=5>AMD AM1 Kabini</td><td class=contentwhite colspan=2>AMD FT3 Kabini</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>&nbsp;</td><td class=tlgrey>A6-5350</td><td class=tlgrey>A4-5150</td><td class=tlgrey>E2-3850</td><td class=tlgrey>E1-2650</td><td class=tlgrey>A6-5200</td><td class=tlgrey>E1-2500</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Cores / Threads</td><td>4 / 4</td><td>4 / 4</td><td>4 / 4</td><td>2 / 2</td><td>4 / 4</td><td>2 / 2</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>CPU Frequency</td><td>2050</td><td>1600</td><td>1300</td><td>1450</td><td>2000</td><td>1400</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>GPU</td><td>HD 8400</td><td>HD 8400</td><td>HD 8280</td><td>HD 8240</td><td>HD 8400</td><td>HD 8240</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>GPU SPs</td><td>128</td><td>128</td><td>128</td><td>128</td><td>128</td><td>128</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>GPU Frequency</td><td>600</td><td>600</td><td>450</td><td>400</td><td>600</td><td>400</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>L2 Cache</td><td>2MB</td><td>2MB</td><td>2MB</td><td>1MB</td><td>2MB</td><td>2MB</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>TDP</td><td>25 W</td><td>25 W</td><td>25 W</td><td>25 W</td><td>25 W</td><td>25 W</td></tr></tbody></table><p>At this time, AMD have not confirmed these SKUs.&nbsp; But we were able to confirm that AMD is aiming at the Kabini APU line to be 128 SPs and 25W.&nbsp; There are no plans to release lower wattage parts.&nbsp; The reasoning behind this is for desktop systems are often not restricted on power, and thus the difference between a 15W APU and a 25W APU is ultimately not that much at the end of the day, and the lower TDP part will sacrifice performance.</p><p>The big competition for AMD in this segment is desktop Bay Trail.&nbsp; AMD is keen to point out the differences between the two:</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/7824/AM1%20vs%20BayTrail_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>So all Kabini APUs will support Windows XP onwards, and all accept both 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems.&nbsp; Maximum memory support is 16GB at DDR3-1600 MHz.&nbsp; A couple of points AMD fail to mention on this slide are relatively important:</p><ul><li>Kabini APUs are all single channel memory, compared to BayTrail / Silvermont CPUs that are dual channel.</li><li>Kabini APUs are 25W, whereas Silvermont CPUs are 10-15W on average.</li><li>Finding a non 64-bit BayTrail system is hard – I only found reference to BayTrail-T CPUs that might be 32-bit only, and these systems are not directly competing with Kabini APUs and the AM1 platform.</li></ul><p>Further questioning to Adam Kozak has suggested that the AM1 systems should support memory overclocking above the verified DDR3-1600 MHz speed.&nbsp; Unfortunately these APUs will not have any Turbo Core technology however, nor will they support CPU overclocking.</p><p>I also probed further on a couple of topics:</p><p><b>Beema Desktop APUs replacing Kabini Desktop: </b>Currently AMD is still discussing whether Beema will be released in a similar vein to AM1, preferably in the same socket despite the presence of the Platform Security Processor.&nbsp; There needs to be some longevity in the platform, but the focus on Beema to begin with will be in the laptop and mobile markets.</p><p><b>Robustness of AM1 over future updates: </b>AMD hope to keep the FS1b socket for the AM1 platform going forward.</p><p><b>Scope for an 8-core Jaguar Kabini APU, or a 2-core and larger IGP: </b>AMD will focus purely on the quad-core APU with 128 SP GCN graphics at this time.</p><p>Having briefly tested Jaguar in a desktop platform in-house, AMD is clearly making a low-end play where volumes can be high while profit-margins are low.&nbsp; Even if the motherboard and APU combined are $60, the rest of the system can easily double that, minus a monitor and an OS, which could bring the total up nearer $200 or $250.&nbsp; At this price point, the main competition is Windows (or Linux) enabled tablets, or depending on the workload, even Android enabled tablets.&nbsp; There is scope for other markets (as a cheaper compute machine) in there too.&nbsp; The single channel memory situation is a little odd when it comes to throughput, reducing peak bandwidth to 12.8 GB/s.&nbsp; The upgradable element for this market means that should faster processors come along, they would be upgradeable, however the jump to a Bulldozer-based architecture could be had for as little as $88 (<a href=#>AMD A4-4000</a> and <a href=#>GIGABYTE F2A55M-DS2</a>) with more IO to play with.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/7824/Motherboards_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><b>Release date for Kabini APUs and motherboards: </b>Formally the AM1 products are to be available in early April, with global availability expected on April 9<span>th</span>.&nbsp; Pricing and APU SKU lists have not been announced, so it is unclear if that $60 target for motherboard plus APU is on the low end or the high end.&nbsp; We have asked regarding samples for the platform and look forward to testing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIR5fpNomKacXZa6cnnPpZitnp%2Bnum6tzaemrqaTmrFuv86cop6slZl6rK3BoqWi</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-make-group-chat-on-snapchat.html><span>←</span><span>You Can Talk With All of Your Friends With Group Chats on Snapchat</span></a>
