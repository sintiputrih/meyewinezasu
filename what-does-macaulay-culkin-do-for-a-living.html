In the years that followed, he remained a pinnacle of theatrical drawing power, making a new generation of children care about Harvey Comics’ Richie Rich in a way that no one could have foreseen and, in a particularly passive-aggressive move, dying of too many bees in My Girl.</p><p data-characters=222 data-current-count=222 data-injectable=false>And then <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he was gone</a>. A few years of high-publicity post-child-star antics, and the guy was out of the spotlight. It was enough to make a person wonder: What’s he doing for a living these days?

Referring to the occasion as his “slip of paper meeting,” he recalled being passed a note from a representative, letting him know that he had enough money to take care of himself forever, as long as he was smart. At present, his net worth is estimated to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $18 million.</p><p data-characters=609 data-current-count=609 data-injectable=true>As a result, Culkin now treats work “like a hobby,” while running Bunny Ears, his own digital media company. He still shows up in projects from time to time, making always-excellent contributions to the Red Letter Media YouTube channel, guesting on a couple of episodes of The Righteous Gemstones, giving a critically praised performance in American Horror Story: Double Feature, and lending his voice to cartoons like Robot Chicken and Netflix’s Entergalactic. But thanks to his unique position as possibly the most visible child of the 1990s, he has the privilege of getting to work, not needing to.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=194 data-current-count=194 data-injectable=false>Meanwhile, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his brother Kieran Culkin</a> still has to appear in award-winning prestige premium cable shows and have his every performance lauded as breathtakingly complex and brilliant.
