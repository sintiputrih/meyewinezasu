The Ministry of Defence will arrange for gun salutes to take place, and a national minute of silence will be announced. A service of remembrance will also be arranged at London's St. Paul's Cathedral.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The prime minister will be the first member of the government to make a statement on the death.

If that is not possible, Operation OVERSTUDY will come into effect, and the coffin will instead be transported by plane. The prime minister and ministers will welcome it upon arrival.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There is an entirely different plan if she were to pass away at Sandringham.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">D-Day+3–D-Day+5</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Charles will receive the motion of condolence at Westminster Hall and later start his tour of the United Kingdom as its new monarch.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When he arrives in Northern Ireland, he will attend a service at St. Anne's Cathedral in Belfast.
