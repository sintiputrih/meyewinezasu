Even more impressive is that she is lying down while playing an electric guitar. A feat that most people can’t seem to accomplish while standing or sitting. Larson is singing and playing along to a song that is currently in the spotlight. None other than the 10-minute version of Taylor Swift’s “All Too Well.”</p><p>Taylor Swift recently released her brand-new re-recorded version of the Red album. The new album is aptly named, Red (Taylor’s Version). Brie Larson is doing her best impression of Swift in the Instagram video. Larson even tagged Taylor Swift in the video with the caption, “what did you do to me!!!”</p><p>The new version of “All Too Well” has made its way through social media and Taylor Swift has even performed it on <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> during her guest spot on November 13th. The song is said to be about <a href=#>ex-boyfriend Jake Gyllenhaal</a>, who dated Swift in 2010. The short film that accompanied the performance on SNL also starred a man that bared a somewhat striking resemblance to Gyllenhaal. The YouTube video of the SNL performance has racked up a staggering 2.7 million views. No wonder Brie Larson has caught wind of the song.</p><p>This isn’t the first time that Brie Larson has shown herself to be one of the biggest Swifties (Taylor Swift fans) in the world. Larson has shown many times over that she is a fan of Swift’s music. Even going so far as to <a href=#>have a photoshoot</a>, which attempts to showcase her own take on the famous see-through shirts that Swift is known to wear.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The “Folklore” core caption is hinting at Taylor Swift’s album, Folklore, which came out in 2020. Said album was no doubt the soundtrack for many Swifties and the depression likely felt from the heart of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>Brie Larson has a wonderfully beautiful singing voice, and many have wondered when Taylor Swift may <a href=#>call on her services</a> to be an opening act.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Brie Larson is shown here singing, “the 1” off Taylor Swift’s album, Folklore. Larson is shown again strumming an electric guitar, but this time with a backbeat of slapping the guitar. A tool in which acoustic guitar players use to mimic the drumbeat for a song.</p><p>It would appear that Brie Larson has what it takes to be a musician. The popular Captain Marvel star has certainly made her case as to what profession she could have been great in if she hadn’t followed her dreams to be an actress in Hollywood. Swift has sadly not reposted or acknowledged Brie Larson’s fandom as of now, but maybe singing “All Too Well” with such skill will finally get Larson her long-awaited meet-up with the pop singer. Maybe Swift isn’t a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If all else fails, Larson might have a good shot at becoming a huge Taylor Swift impersonator. Her voice is that good.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnkqe2pnnLmqmsp55iw6qwxKhkrZmpobyzedKwoJ%2BsXp3Brrg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./signs-you-are-angry-person.html><span>←</span><span>10 Signs You Might Be An Angry Person</span></a>
