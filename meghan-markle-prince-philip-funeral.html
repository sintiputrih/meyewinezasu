Designed by florist Willow Crossley, who previously completed floral arrangements for the evening portion of the Sussexes' 2018 wedding in Frogmore Gardens as well as for their son Archie's christening at Windsor Castle, the wreath features flowers with some special meaning, as requested by the duke and duchess. It includes bear's breeches, which are the national flower of Greece, to represent Prince Philip's heritage, as well as sea holly, which represent the late prince's service in the Royal Marines. Other symbolic flowers featured are campanula for gratitude and everlasting love, rosemary for remembrance, lavender for devotion, and roses in honor of Prince Philip's birth month.</p><img alt="l r britains prince philip, duke of edinburgh, us actress and fiancee of britains prince harry meghan markle and britains prince harry r arrive to attend the royal familys traditional christmas day church service at st mary magdalene church in sandringham, norfolk, eastern england, on december 25, 2017 afp photo adrian dennis photo credit should read adrian dennisafp via getty images" title=BRITAIN-ROYALS-CHRISTMAS width=1934 height=1284 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-898514890-1618667805.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">ADRIAN DENNIS</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Prince Philip, Prince Harry, and Meghan Markle arrive at St Mary Magdalene Church on December 25, 2017.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a36074350/prince-harry-meghan-markle-release-statement-philip-death/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="couple previously honored Prince Philip" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">couple previously honored Prince Philip</a> after Buckingham Palace announced his death on April 9.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"In loving memory of His Royal Highness, The Duke of Edinburgh, 1921-2021," read a message on the homepage of their nonprofit organization's official website, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://archewell.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Archewell class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Archewell</a>.
