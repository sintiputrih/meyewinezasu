According to one of his tweets last week, in fact, the writer admitted to being a fan of the off-the-wall flicks and even has a personal recommendation for his fans.</p><p>“I enjoy Lifetime Movie Network films while doing morning exercises. How can you go wrong with DERANGED GRANNY?”</p><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=693 data-injectable=true>There you have it, folks. The man who’s come up with some of the scariest tales ever put to paper spends many of his mornings watching low budget pics on a channel that’s also home to shows like Dance Moms and Married at First Sight. Surprising, yeah, but King has already proven himself to have a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">great taste in cinema</a>, so give him the benefit of the doubt until you’ve heard the film’s synopsis.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/15989921772673729-14.jpg alt="Deranged Granny" width=1000 height=515 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=334 data-injectable=false>This particular feature tells the story, as the title might suggest, of an elderly woman named Barbara who’s not all that she appears to be. The eponymous character is desperate to become a grandmother and uses her new daughter-in-law Kendall’s children from a previous marriage to finally fill the emptiness in her heart.</p><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=715 data-injectable=true>Her love for the kids quickly morphs into an obsession of epic proportions, though, that threatens the lives of everyone around her. Barbara will do anything to keep her new grandchildren in her life, including murder. Kendall soon realizes that she and her family may be in danger and resolves to out the seemingly innocuous senior citizen as a monster before it’s too late.</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>People can feel free to mock Lifetime movies all they want, but there’s no denying that the plot actually sounds kind of awesome. Maybe <strong>Stephen King</strong> is on to something here. After all, he does <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">know how to deliver a scare</a> better than basically anyone else alive. Judge me all you want, but I’m going to go ahead and put this one on my watch list.</p><p data-characters=85 data-current-count=442 data-injectable=false>Deranged Granny is currently streaming on Hulu for those with a premium subscription.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqq2doJ2yr3nKoqWgZZ%2BZsW65zq%2BgnmWimrCwucyepZ2ZpJ68r3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./simon-helbergs-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>Simon Helbergs Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</span></a>
