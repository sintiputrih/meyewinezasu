Jean” column appeared in Elle magazine from 1993 through 2019, becoming one of the longest-running advice columns in American publishing.</p><p>Carroll has written several magazines, books, and anthologies. In her 2019 book, “Do We Need Men For?: A Modest Proposal”, she accused Les Moonves and Donald Trump of sexually assaulting her in the mid-1990s.</p><p>However, both Moonves and Mr Trump denied the allegations. Carroll subsequently sued Trump in New York Supreme Court for defamation and battery.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>In November 2019, Carroll filed a defamation lawsuit with the New York Supreme Court. The suit states that Mr. Trump had damaged her reputation, substantially harmed her professionally, and caused emotional pain</p><p>Carroll stated “Decades ago, the now President of the United States raped me. When I had the courage to speak out about the attack, he defamed my character, accused me of lying for personal gain, and even insulted my appearance.”</p><p>In November 2022, Carroll sued Mr. Trump for battery in New York under the Adult Survivors Act, a law passed the previous May that briefly allows sexual assault victims to file civil suits regardless of expired statutes of limitations.</p><p>On April 13, 2023, Carroll disclosed that part of her legal expenses were funded by Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn, venture capitalist, and donor to the Democratic Party.</p><p>In May 2023, Carroll hit the headlines when a jury of six men and three women found Donald Trump liable for sexual assault (but not rape), battery, and defamation against Carroll.</p><p>On the issue of rape, the jury found that Carroll had not proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the former President had raped her.</p><p>However, the jury found that Carroll had proved that Trump had sexually abused her. The American journalist, author, and advice columnist, Carroll was awarded $5 million in damages.</p><p>The Manhattan jury ordered Mr Trump to pay her about $5m (£4m) in damages. The jury of six men and three women reached their decision after less than three hours of deliberations on Tuesday, May 9, 2023.</p><p>Because the trial was in civil court rather than criminal, Mr. Trump will not be required to register as a sex offender. The former president who has denied Ms. Carroll’s accusations did not attend the two-week civil trial in the Manhattan federal court.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/10114507/E-Jean-Carroll-1024x575.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>E Jean Carroll Age</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>E Jean Carroll</a> celebrated her 79th birthday in December last year (2022).
