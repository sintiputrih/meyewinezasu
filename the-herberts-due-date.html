She is represented by NEXT Models, and she has done campaigns for Tommy Hilfiger, Dick's Sporting Goods, and Frank & Eileen.&nbsp;</p><p>Josh is a musician, and he independently released his eponymous album in 2015. He went on to open on tour for The Chicks (who were formerly known as the Dixie Chicks).</p><p>The couple got married in 2019, and they started their YouTube channel in the summer of 2020.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">When is The Herberts' due date?</h2><p>The influencer couple will welcome their first baby together in May of 2021. In their YouTube video, "Finding Out I'm PREGNANT!," Abbie chronicled how she found out that she was expecting.</p><p>After they began trying in August of 2020, Abbie routinely took pregnancy tests. When she got a few positive results in a row, she started filming her reaction.&nbsp;</p><p>When she confirmed the news, she bought a unisex onesie to tell Josh. She filmed the first few seconds of his reaction, before turning the camera off to keep the moment private.</p><p>The 24-year-old detailed the pregnancy news in an Instagram post as well, which also included sonogram images.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Abbie Herbert (@abbieherbert_)</a></p></figure><p>"I'M PREGNANT! OMG!!! We are having a little bean May 2021. I've prayed & dreamed my entire life to become a Mom & it's finally here. I'm so blessed and lucky my child gets to have the coolest & sassiest Dad on the planet. Y'all know I've been asking for this little bean on TikTok all summer. What started as a joke for fun quickly turned into 'OK let's do this!!!'"</p><p>Abbie then discussed how she was worried beforehand that her diagnosis of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome might affect things.&nbsp;</p><p>"We decided in August it was time to start 'trying' & being diagnosed with PCOS I had no idea what my fertility journey would be like. I'm beyond grateful & blessed to be able to bring our child into this world. This has been the most amazing and terrifying journey of my life from talking all night about names for our bean to any little ache/pain scaring the crap out of me. I'm excited for the next 20+ weeks to grow our bean & share our journey with y'all!..." Abbie wrote, before thanking her fans.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Josh and Abbie later revealed the sex of their baby in a vlog.</h2><p>When the YouTube duo originally announced Abbie's pregnancy, they did not know the sex of their baby. But, they previously decided that Abbie would select the name if it was a girl, and Josh would pick the moniker if it was a boy.&nbsp;</p><p>In their Dec. 3 video, "OUR GENDER REVEAL!" the couple found out through a scavenger hunt and a confetti cannon that they were having a girl.</p><p>"I'm so excited!" Abbie exclaimed. "I can't believe it."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>"I'm in for some trouble if this little pumpkin looks anything like her mom," Josh joked. "No, I couldn't be any more excited that it's a girl. I think I'll be a great girl dad. I grew up with two sisters, so I think I'll fit the mold really well."</p><p>If they stick with their original plan, then Abbie will be naming their bundle of joy in May.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the couple has gained a fanbase by sharing the details of their lives, it can be expected that they'll do the same when it comes to Abbie's pregnancy.&nbsp;</p><p>You can watch The Herberts' pregnancy reveal video below!</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbWmeceeqZudoqnAbrDUnmSdmaSa</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wantep-age-twitch-face-merch-real-name-instagramwikibiography.html><span>←</span><span>Wantep Age, Twitch, Face, Merch, Real Name, Instagram,Wiki,Biography.</span></a>
