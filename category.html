If you were thinking “hmm… maybe margaritas for New Years Eve this year?”&nbsp;then&nbsp;you’ve come to the right place. Well almost. I originally planned&nbsp;to make a version of my go-to pomegranate cocktail when these sweet&nbsp;ruby red grapefruits showed up in my Farmhouse box last week. They were a lovely surprise&nbsp;because, well,&nbsp;I’ve been over-doing it on the pomegranates lately, and I was so excited by the idea of a pink drink instead.&nbsp;While&nbsp;Jack&nbsp;is not a fan of grapefruit in general, he&nbsp;loves&nbsp;a paloma cocktail – essentially a grapefruit margarita. This is a slightly lighter…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Thanksgiving has become an odd holiday for us. During the first years that&nbsp;Jack and I were together, we traveled to visit family&nbsp;for every single&nbsp;holiday. It took us a while to&nbsp;realize that Thanksgiving weekend air travel is the worst of them all. So now we have a tradition of staying home with no real tradition. One year we stayed in and made&nbsp;risotto. The year after that we had a friends-giving (before they were called that). Last year, we stayed home and worked (we were just beginning the book). This year we’re going to gather with friends over a fun & easygoing…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>We’re getting the weekend started a little early today with my favorite happy hour drink…the jalapeño margarita! It’s spicy, tart, slightly sweet, and super refreshing over ice. You only need 6 simple ingredients to make it, and it’s easy to stir together (no cocktail shaker required!). So what are you waiting for? Pass the tortilla chips, and enjoy! Jalapeño Margarita Recipe Ingredients To make this spicy margarita recipe, you need 6 simple ingredients: Tequila&nbsp;– Use any good-quality blanco tequila in this recipe. We like&nbsp;this brand, but feel free to use your favorite! A jalapeño pepper – Use anywhere from 1/4…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>For as long as I can remember, my family’s Christmas season officially started with cookies. Before we were even tall enough to reach the countertop, my mom would pull over kitchen chairs so my sister and I could “help” out and get our hands in the flour. She would get out the baking sheets, the ingredients, and the flour-dusted recipes that were reserved only for the holiday season. We’d bake batch after batch after batch, eating more cookie dough than actual cookies. This year, to kick off our holiday season, I created a little cookie & cocktail party taking inspiration…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Last week I had the opportunity to go on a super fun trip to Boulder Colorado to visit the headquarters of Celestial Seasonings. I’ve been drinking their tea for years so it was fun to learn more about the process of making tea and meet the wonderful people behind the brand. The trip started with the warmest welcome (the employees greeted us outside, cheering and holding signs with&nbsp;each of&nbsp;our blog names on them!). I drank about a million cups of tea (Sweet Harvest Pumpkin is totally my new favorite). After that, my highlights of the visit were: listening to Kay…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>In case I haven’t mentioned it before – it’s pretty hot here. I’ve been eating watermelon like crazy because, well, I think it just might be the most refreshing fruit on the planet. I had been thinking of making watermelon margaritas until I had the most refreshing elderflower & vodka watermelon cocktail made by the&nbsp;Tipsy Texan&nbsp;a few weeks ago at the opening of&nbsp;Métier Cook’s Supply&nbsp;(a really cute kitchen supply store, btw – if you’re in Austin, go check it out). This is definitely a simplified version&nbsp;but I get impatient to make cocktails that have&nbsp;more than just a few easy ingredients.…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Happy Friday! I have the easiest,&nbsp;summeriest cocktail&nbsp;to share with you: peach sangria! This weekend, it’s going to be 102 degrees(!) here in Austin. Because hot summer days call for cold, refreshing drinks, I decided to come up with a new summer party drink recipe. I figure everyone loves sangria, so I thought – what would be more seasonal than peach sangria? Now one of my favorite sangria recipes, this drink is sweet, but not too sweet, and packed full of fruit and herbs. Peach Sangria Recipe Ingredients The base is simple: white wine, Grand Marnier, and fresh peaches.&nbsp;I also added…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I just realized that I have a pattern of only posting cocktails on Fridays. I don’t know if it feels more socially appropriate that a cocktail should be a pre-weekend treat or if I’m trying to cover up the fact that I’m known to have a glass of wine (or two), on any given day(s) throughout the week. I like to celebrate the little wins in life, even if a “win” is just getting through an ordinary Monday. This week, however, is not about ordinary Mondays. I just about fell off my chair two days ago when I found out…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>My favorite part about the holidays: Getting together with friends and having an excuse to indulge just a little too much. We can all resolve to be better in January… until then, let’s have that extra cookie or three, and by all means pop that prosecco! This is one of my favorite cocktails to make at home. I make a quick simple syrup and let it steep with handfuls of fresh mint….combine it with vodka, pomegranate juice, prosecco, and then finish it off with a squeeze of lemon. It’s not too sweet, and it’s just a little tart – exactly…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Whether you celebrate Thanksgiving, Friends-giving, or my personal favorite holiday –&nbsp;random Sunday&nbsp;– here’s your fall party cocktail.&nbsp;It’ll make you look like a good put-together host because you’ll have it ready as your guests walk through the door. No one has to know that you made (most of) it the day before. This is full of warm fall spices but it’s actually pretty light and refreshing. Crisp vodka gets mixed with sweet spiced apple juice… and a squeeze of lemon pulls it all together (doesn’t it always?). Serve with apple slices, cinnamon sticks, and star anise, because aren’t those little stars…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Happy weekend! I just wanted to pop in for a minute and share this easy recipe for the spicy margaritas we served at our&nbsp;margarita party a few weeks ago. They were such a big hit – &nbsp;tart, smooth, not too sweet, and most importantly – spicy.&nbsp;The perfect refreshing cocktail for one last summer party! photos #1 and #3 by Chris Perez of Citygram Magazine</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvVnpinnJyaurC60meaqKVfmK61scaoqbJnpaPCtLHDaJqom5uprqq4jqmYoJ1faHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./princess-monique-filmz.html><span>←</span><span>Princess Monique Filmz Biography, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Family</span></a>
