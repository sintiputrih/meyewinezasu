She was revealed to be Star-Lord’s half-sister, as she was also one of Ego’s children. Mantis and Drax (Dave Bautista) had a few conversations regarding Ego in the special, so it might be worth unpacking if the Celestial might make a return to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-will-ego-return-to-the-mcu data-injectable=false>Will Ego return to the MCU?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ego-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2.jpg><p data-characters=753 data-current-count=1053 data-injectable=true>Ego was played by Kurt Russell, and he was the primary antagonist of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 after it was revealed that he killed Star-Lord’s mother, as well as many of his other children. At the end of the movie, like many other villains in the MCU, he was killed by the heroes, and his evil plan to use Peter was thwarted. Could he eventually return to the MCU? Maybe. It is unlikely that the character would return in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</a> as it feels like Star-Lord has settled that area of his life. It would be odd if they were to reuse the same villain in two films in a row, and it would not make sense for Kurt Russell to return for a cameo appearance unless a post-credits scene were to set up something larger for Ego.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special-3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special-2-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special-6.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special-5.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special-4.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special-8.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special-7.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special-1-1.jpg><p data-characters=539 data-current-count=539 data-injectable=true>Even though the character died in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, he was a Celestial and could make a return in some shape or form. We shouldn’t rule out Ego reappearing in some sort of sequel to The Eternals, and you shouldn’t rule anybody out for the upcoming Avengers: Secret Wars as anyone from Marvel’s past could easily return in the movie.&nbsp;Still, it is quite unlikely that Ego will reform somehow and make a return to the MCU after his death. It might be better if Star-Lord and Mantis were just left alone in peace.</p><p data-characters=147 data-current-count=147 data-injectable=false>Catch The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special on Disney Plus now, and check out Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 when it releases on May 5, 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomqitnJl6prPOZqmerKWnu27AzmaroZ1dorC2ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./144234-13-90s-movie-characters-you-totally-wanted-to-be.html><span>←</span><span>13 '90s Movie Characters You Totally Wanted To Be</span></a>
