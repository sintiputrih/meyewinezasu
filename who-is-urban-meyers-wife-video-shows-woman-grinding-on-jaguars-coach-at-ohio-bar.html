Video shows woman grinding on Jaguars coach at Ohio bar</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>A video of the <a href=# rel>Jaguars'</a>&nbsp;new head coach Urban Meyer has gone viral after it showed him sitting at a bar while a woman dances and grinds up against him. Social media observers were quick to empathize with his wife Shelley Meyer, but it seems she knew about the outing.</p><p>The 57-year-old <a href=# rel>NFL coach</a> was apparently spotted at his bar, Pint House, in Short North, Ohio as he let loose among a large <a href=#>crowd of patrons</a>. While it is a common sight for opposite sexes to get comfortable at any establishment with loud music and alcohol, social media users pointed out that the lady in the video was <a href=# rel>not the head coach's wife</a> of 35 years.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Steven Johnson: Meet ex-NFL player who slept with estranged wife of Steph Curry's dad</a></p><p><a href=# rel>NFL’s Ravens may fire Earl Thomas for alleged affair after his wife held him at gunpoint</a></p><p>Photos and videos of the alleged outing began making the rounds on social media on Saturday, October 2.</p><p>In the clip, Meyer appeared to have his arm in front of him to serve as a barrier between him and the woman, suggesting that the grinding was unwanted from his end but he didn't want to be rude to the woman. Other photos showed him having a drink in his hand while taking picture with a woman.</p><p>However, while the video may be somewhat embarrassing to his family and the Jacksonville Jaguars, it seems Meyer's wife knew exactly where he was that night.</p><p>Shelley Meyer shared a photo of her husband at his bar in Columbus and commented saying she was babysitting their grandsons in the meanwhile. She even added the hashtag “buddy deserved a night out,” meaning she genuinely felt her husband needed to blow off some steam as he probably has been toiling hard since taking over the Jaguars.</p><p>The NFL legend spoke of his team's “heartbreaking” losing streak after the Jaguars’ devastating loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, marking their 19th consecutive loss. “I’ve said this from Day 1: The core of this team has good players,” he said, as quoted by ESPN. “We’re getting better each week. It’s sickening we couldn’t win that game. I’m not wrong about the guys in that room… That’s a heartbroken locker room. We’ve got to get them back.”</p><h2 class=split>Who is Urban Meyer's wife?</h2><p>Shelley Mathey Meyer is a certified nurse and wife of Jacksonville Jaguars coach Urban Meyer. The two met at a Sigma Chi Derby Day party in college, where she was a Zeta Tau Alpha member and was challenged to make a frat member smile without touching them. "This was hilarious. I got a Playboy — my first and only one I've ever bought — and I walked by the guys and opened the centerfold and said, 'Does this look like me?'" she told First Coast News.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/1362ed36-d565-4a5d-81f1-0cba1c7999a6.95524515><p>Urban Meyer, who was standing by a set of stairs, caught her attention as she caught his. "So the next guy that came down, I go, 'Who was that?'" she remembered. &nbsp;"He says, 'UB'. She couldn't believe that was someone's name. Then the guy says, 'His real name is Urban. I said, 'What kind of name is that?'" She later learned the name carried great respect — from the names of several Popes and the football legacy in her husband's family of three generations.</p><p>The couple dated for five years before tying the knot in 1986. They have three children together, daughters Nicole and Gisela, and son Nathan.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjK6pm5meYrqmxcSrqmavmZuybsLInZyoZaOdvLi%2FjLCmppmeYrSztc2doKefXaS7brbAoKyaqqNisLCtwqFkmqxdpLWqu4ybmKs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-damien-haas-dating-now-past-relationships-current-status-and-rumours-html.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Damien Haas Dating Now?
