Today, the Duke of Sussex surprised attendees of the virtual Diana Awards with a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a33024007/prince-harry-black-lives-matter-diana-awards-speech/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="sentimental address" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">sentimental address</a> for the charity's honorees, in which he also addressed the current Black Lives Matter movement.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I know that my mother has been an inspiration to many of you, and I can assure you she would have been fighting in your corner. Like many of you, she never took the easy route or the popular one or the comfortable one. But she stood for something, and she stood up for people who needed it," Harry said. "Right now, we are seeing situations around the world where division, isolation, and anger are dominating, as pain and trauma come to the surface. But I see the greatest hope in people like you, and I'm confident about the world's future and its ability to heal, because it is in your hands."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He also briefly mentioned Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. "My wife said recently that our generation and the ones before us haven't done enough to right the wrongs of the past. I, too, am sorry—sorry that we haven't got the world to a place you deserve it to be," said Harry. "Institutional racism has no place in our societies, yet it is still endemic. Unconscious bias must be acknowledged without blame to create a better world for all of you."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
