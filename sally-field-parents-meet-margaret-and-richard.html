Sally Margaret Field is an American actress. She is well-known for her extensive work in theater and film, and over the course of her career spanning more than five decades, she has won numerous honors, including two Academy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, three Primetime Emmy Awards, a Tony Award, and two British Academy Film Awards nominations.</p><p>A lot of people have been inquiring lot about Sally Field parents and making various research about them on the internet.</p><p>This article talks about Sally Field parents and everything there is to know about them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Biography of Sally Field</h2><p>In Pasadena, California, Sally Margeret Field was born on November 6th, 1946. Her mother divorced her father in 1950, not long after he returned from serving in World War II.</p><p>Jock Mahoney, an actor and stuntman, who later remarried, became Sally’s adopted father. Field acknowledged in a 2018 memoir that Mahoney had molested her when she was a little child.</p><p>Sally started out as a cheerleader in high school. Future famous people like Michael Milken, Cindy Williams, and Michael Ovitz were among her classmates.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sally Field Career</h2><p>In 1966, the sitcom “Gidget,” which was canceled after only one season, gave Sally Field her first significant acting role. Despite the fact that the program was a failure, ABC recognized Field’s considerable talent and awarded her a prominent role in the program “The Flying Nun.”</p><p>This program, which was more popular, ran from 1967 to 1970. The movie “The Flying Nun” helped Sally become well-known, but it was also detrimental to her in many ways. She was treated unfairly by the show’s producers, and as a result, she was typecast in later parts.</p><p>She made appearances in movies like “Maybe I’ll Come Home in the Spring” and television shows including “Alias Smith and Jones,” “Night Gallery,” and “The Girl With Something Extra” throughout the middle of the 1970s. As her previous program was canceled after only one season, Field made the decision to reinvent herself by taking acting classes with renowned acting teacher Lee Strasberg. She developed her acting skills and discarded the stereotype of “the girl next door” during her training.</p><p>Her newly acquired acting abilities assisted her in securing the lead part in the 1976 television movie “Sybil.” Field received an Emmy Award for her portrayal of a woman with multiple personality disorder in the movie. She was able to prove to herself that she was more than just a sitcom actress thanks to the job.</p><p>She worked with Burt Reynolds and acted in the movie “Smokey and the Bandit” in 1977. She returned to the part in several of the sequels, which helped the movie become one of the highest-grossing movies of the year. She once more displayed her dramatic acting prowess in the 1979 film “Norma Rae.” Field’s performance was universally praised by critics, and as a result, she was honored with an Oscar Award for Best Actress.</p><p>Sally Fields changed things up once more in the early 1980s when she starred alongside Tommy Lee Jones as a prostitute in “Back Roads.” Sally once more defied expectations and displayed her adaptability. She also won praise from critics for the movies “Absence of Malice” and “Kiss Me Goodbye.” She received a second Oscar in 1984 for her performance in “Places in the Heart.” She made appearances in movies like “Murphy’s Romance” and “Steel Magnolias” for the remainder of the 1990s.</p><p>Field switched to supporting roles in movies like “Mrs. Doubtfire” and “Forrest Gump” throughout the 1990s, although she also had more prominent parts in “Soapdish,” “Not Without My Daughter,” and “Eye for an Eye.” She began directing movies like “The Christmas Tree” in the late 1990s. She went on to direct a number of additional movies and TV shows. She played the lead in movies like “Where the Heart is” and “Legally Blonde 2: Red, White, and Blonde” in the early 2000s. She also made a comeback to television with a recurring part in “ER,” where she won an Emmy for playing a woman with bipolar disorder.</p><p>Sally Field made a comeback in 2012 when she played Aunt May in the movie “The Amazing Spider-Man.” In the 2014 sequel, she played the same part again. She also made an appearance in the movie “Lincoln” at this time. She landed the main part in “Hello, My Name is Doris” in 2015 before garnering high praise for her Broadway performance in “The Glass Menagerie,” which premiered the same year.</p><p>Who are the parent of Sally Field?
