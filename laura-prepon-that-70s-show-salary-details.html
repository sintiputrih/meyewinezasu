Although she didn’t have much professional experience before joining the cast of That 70s Show, by the time the series came to an end, Prepon was making a small fortune per episode.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Filming The Final Episode Of That '70s Show Was A Nightmare For Laura Prepon</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=laura-prepon-was-cast-as-donna-in-that-70s-show-just-because-of-these-two-words>Laura Prepon Was Cast As Donna In That 70s Show Just Because Of These Two Words</h2><p>That 70s Show launched many young stars into international stardom, including Laura Prepon. Before appearing on the show, Prepon had only had a couple of small professional acting gigs, appearing in plays like A Woman of Property and Ascension Day and starring in the Levi Strauss-developed soap opera, They Go On. In addition to this, Prepon also had experience working as a model.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Laura-Prepon.jpg><p>If you ask die-hard fans, they’ll tell you that Prepon was born to play Donna Pinciotti. As it turns out, the creators of the show knew this immediately after her first audition. In a 2020 interview for Entertainment Weekly, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Prepon revealed the two words she said in her audition</a> that landed her this iconic role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"One of the things that's really funny is later after I got on the show, I had said to our creators, Bonnie and Terri Turner, 'What was the thing that made you know that I was Donna?'" she revealed.</p><p>"They said, 'First of all, when you came in, you just were Donna. You were Donna Pinciotti; you were perfect for her.' And at the end of the audition, I looked at them and I said, 'We good?' And I put my hands on the table and I pushed off like a total tomboy. It was just how I got up from my table. They said that sealed the deal."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Laura Prepon Used To Date This 'That '70s Show' Co-Star</a></span></p><p>During a 2020 interview with CBS News, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Prepon revealed that she felt like she didn’t have enough experience</a> when she originally landed the role of Donna on this popular sitcom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I had no idea what I was doing when I booked That 70s Show," she admitted, noting that her acting ability was incredibly limited at the time. However, the similarities between herself and her character greatly helped, "It was a glove that I could slide right into, and it fit perfectly. That was really great for [my] first role."</p><h2 id=laura-prepon-made-between-250-000-to-350-000-towards-the-end-of-that-70s-show>Laura Prepon Made Between $250,000 To $350,000 Towards The End Of That 70s Show</h2><p>Starring on That 70s Show not only had a significant impact on Laura Prepon’s career but also on her wealth. By playing Donna Pinciotti on the show’s eight seasons, Prepon amassed the majority of her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$12 million net worth</a>. In fact, by the time the show came to an end, Prepon was one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar52245357.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Glamour Path, Laura earned between $250,000 to $350,000 per episode while filming the last seasons of That 70s Show which was huge for such a young actress.
