<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Gary Rossington net worth: How rich was Gary Rossington?</h1></header><section class=post-content><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Gary Robert Rossington, a celebrated American musician and songwriter, passed away on March 5, 2023. Rossington’s most notable contribution was being a founding member of the Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, where he played lead and rhythm guitar. He was also a co-founder of the Rossington Collins Band with his former bandmate Allen Collins. Born in Jacksonville, Florida, Rossington initially had a strong interest in baseball and aspired to play for the New York Yankees. However, his love for music sparked in his early teens after hearing the Rolling Stones, and he eventually gave up on his baseball dreams.</p><p>Interestingly, it was Rossington’s passion for baseball that led to the formation of Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1964. After meeting Ronnie Van Zant and Bob Burns while playing on rival Jacksonville baseball teams, the trio jammed together, ultimately leading to the formation of The Noble Five. They later changed their name to The One Percent before finally settling on the name Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1969. Rossington grew up in a single-parent household, and Van Zant acted as a father figure to him, teaching him and his bandmates how to drive and introducing them to various life skills when they were teenagers.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>When Rossington was suspended from school for having long hair, Lacy Van Zant pleaded his case to school administrators, explaining that Rossington’s mother relied on the money he earned from his band. Rossington eventually dropped out of high school to focus on Lynyrd Skynyrd full-time. Rossington’s passing is a great loss to the music industry, and his contributions will be remembered for generations to come.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><strong>Read also: <a href=#>Gary Rossington wife: Meet Dale Krantz-Rossington</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-was-gary-rossington-net-worth><strong>What was Gary Rossington net worth?</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Gary Rossington was a highly successful American musician with a net worth of $40 million. His career started in his teenage years when he formed the band The Noble Five with his friends in 1964. He is widely recognized as a founding member of Lynyrd Skynyrd, one of the most successful and influential rock bands of all time.</p><p>With Lynyrd Skynyrd, Gary Rossington achieved massive commercial success and critical acclaim throughout the 1970s, with hits such as “Sweet Home Alabama,” “Free Bird,” and “Simple Man.” Despite the tragic plane crash in 1977 that killed several of the band’s members, Rossington continued to play with Lynyrd Skynyrd for decades and remained one of the driving forces behind the band’s success. His talent, hard work, and dedication to his craft have helped him become one of the most successful musicians of his generation.</p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunCzwKuwZqqfqMCqusatpqdlnprBbsPOq6uhZZikxG6%2ByJyfZq%2BRqHqordGyZKuno6i2r7PTqKVo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./5-facts-kareem-abdul-jabbar-jr-net-worth-children.html><span>←</span><span>5 Facts About Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Jr. Including Details Of His Net Worth, Children And More</span></a>
